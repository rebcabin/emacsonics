* Introduction

I memorize numbers in any radix (base) by hallucinating poems,
stories, or mental cartoon movies via the Mnemonic Major System:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system

My hallucinations come with synaesthesia: smells, heat, texture,
colors, brightness, etc. I use only imagination, no drugs. Many
memory practitioners do not use synaesthesia, but they help me.

Krill calls the hallucinations "phantasmagorias" and the inputs
for them "phantasmagorishables," which itself encodes the digits
8210 3746 95.

https://folk.ntnu.no/krill/pseudonumerology.htm

My methods are based on tables of

- pegs :: permanent, immutable hallucinogens in one-to-one
  correspondence to numbers. For instance, the number 68 is a
  chef, and I smell the kitchen and hear the sounds of boiling and
  sizzling. Whenever I see a chef or think of one, I instantly
  think of the number 68. That's 1-to-1 correspondence.

- sound-alikes :: fluid, mutable list of hallucinogenic words that
  are similar in their consonant sounds to the pegs and in
  many-to-one correspondence to the numbers. 68's "chef" sounds
  like "chief," "sheaf," "Java," "chaff," amongst others. While 68
  always means "chef," first, a chef might not fit well into an
  ongoing hallucination. For instance, if we're memorizing 276872,
  the pegs are NECK, CHEF, and CAN. That sequence does not invoke
  an obvious story, so we start looking for sound-alikes. How
  about INCA CHIEF COIN? Just picture a coin with an Inca chief
  embossed on it, and we're done. It took a little time to devise
  INCA CHIEF COIN from NECK CHEF CAN, but the other direction is
  instantaneous. It's many-to-one because there are many words
  that map to each number.

See the last section, Section [[all-pegs]] of this document, after the
Appendices, for the complete maps of numbers to pegs and
sound-alikes.

For radices beyond decimal, I choose a mapping from alphabetic
glyphs to ASCII because I already have the mapping memorized for
instant, bidirectional recall (Section [[daily-practice]]). In
appendices, I show some alternative mappings for people who don't
have ASCII memorized.

* The System of Sound-Alikes
<<basic-pegs>>

The pegs for the decimal digits, with some mnemonic hints, are

|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
| digit | peg  | mnemonic                                   | sound-alike rules     |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     0 | saw  | circular saw, sawed log; round like "0"    | s, z                  |
|     1 | tea  | giant Disneyland teacup;                   | d, th, dh (them)      |
|       |      | "t" looks like "1"                         |                       |
|     2 | Noah | ... and the Ark; "n" has 2 legs            | ng                    |
|       |      | (2 = ng for Krill only, nk is always 27)   |                       |
|     3 | me   | ... in the mirror tying a bow tie;         |                       |
|       |      | "m" has 3 legs                             |                       |
|     4 | ray  | this one is hard to remember;              |                       |
|       |      | just brute-force it                        |                       |
|     5 | law  | 5 fingers as the cop holds up his hand     |                       |
|     6 | jaw  | "6" looks like Lurch's lantern jaw         | sh, ch, zh (pleasure) |
|     7 | key  | "7" looks like an Allen key                | g, ng                 |
|       |      | (7 = ng for Furst and me, nk is always 27) |                       |
|     8 | fee  | "8" looks like a dollar sign               | f, v                  |
|     9 | pea  | The Princess and the Pea: 9 mattresses     | p, b                  |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|

Memorize this table, or one like it, by whatever means, by brute
force if necessary. The rest of the system relies on it. If you
don't like these specific pegs, pick some others out of the rows
for 0 through 9 in Section [[all-pegs]]. Pick your own peg for each
digit, make your own table, memorize it, and stick with it
forever. NEVER, EVER CHANGE ANYTHING IN IT. I did that once more
than 50 years ago, and I continue to regret it. This table must
become an internal, effortless vocabulary like your native
language.

Make up pegs and sound-alikes for longer numbers by combining
consonant sounds. For example, here is the peg and sound-alikes
for 32:

#+begin_src clojure :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 132 133)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
|----+-------+---------+--------+--------+------+-------|
| 32 | MAN   | mane    | mine   | minnow | moon | woman |
|    | amen  | ammonia | human  | hymen  | main | mana  |
|    | mania | manna   | many   | mean   | mien | moan  |
|    | money | omen    | yeoman |        |      |       |
:end:

*/Notes on such tables/*:

- the peg is in all-caps and in first position

- the first line contains six preferred sound-alikes in preference order

- the remaining sound-alikes appear in alphabetical order

"MAN" is the peg: it is /equal/ to 32 in your mind. I hallucinate
Superman flying out of the phone booth or arriving to Save the
Day. The Sound-Alikes help you create phantasmagorias (aka
hallucinations) from long strings of numbers by devising a story.
With practice, you can get fast. Eran Katz, who teaches this
method professionally, often opens his lectures with a stunt
wherein he memorizes hundreds of digits as quickly as the audience
calls them out and his assistant writes them down.

We go to three digits in this document. That means that every
number from 00 through 099 and 0 through 1000 has a peg and a list
of sound-alikes. For instance, here is the list for 352:

#+begin_src clojure :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 452 453)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
|-----+--------+------------+------------+----------+----------+----------|
| 352 | MELON  | Himalayans | hemline    | semolina | milliner | homeland |
|     | malign | melancholy | millennium | million  |          |          |
:end:

For words with three internal consonants, leading zeros and all
sounds after the third consonant do not count. "Semolina" encodes
352 despite the leading "s." "Semolina" does not encode 035
because the "n" in "...ina" is a third internal consonant. For
035, indeed, we have the following.

#+begin_src clojure :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 35 36)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
|-----+------------+----------+--------+---------+--------+----------|
| 035 | SAWMILL    | smile    | smell  | small   | simile | sea-mile |
|     | assimilate | seamless | seemly | similar |        |          |
:end:

"Assimilate" is an apparent exception to the rule, inherited from Furst.
At speed, I would probably read it as 351 and not as 35. Let's see what
our dictionary has for 351 (the dictionary source for this document is
stored in file =core.clj=. The tables in this document are automatically
formatted from raw data in that source file every time this document is
exported from org-mode to PDF).

#+begin_src clojure :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 451 452)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:results:
|-----+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+----------+--------------|
| 351 | MALT    | melt      | mold       | omelet    | smelt    | mulatto      |
|     | emulate | hamlet    | homiletics | humility  | malady   | mallet       |
|     | meld    | melodrama | melody     | milady    | mild     | military     |
|     | millet  | muleteer  | multiple   | multitude | simulate | simultaneous |
|     | smolder | umlaut    |            |           |          |              |
:end:

Yup, "assimilate" is ambiguous: it's both . TODO: fix this.

"Millenium" encodes 352 despite the trailing "...ium."

Vowels and the weak consonants "h," "w," "wh," "y," and so on, do
not count. Thus, "Himalayans" is 352 because the first non-weak
consonant is "m" for 3.

My basic 2-digit peg list appears below, extended from 99 to
127 for ASCII and with nine extra pegs for court cards (Section
[[card-pack]]). I know this table by heart. My Dad and many memory
experts know pegs for 3 digits by heart and "compute" sound-alikes
on-the-fly. I'm not that good, yet.

* Credit-Card Numbers

Consider the following, fake VISA number from

https://www.getcreditcardnumbers.com

\vskip 0.26cm
#+begin_src text
  4716 5752 8659 3825
#+end_src

From the peg list, we get

| 4716 | rack tissue |
| 5752 | lake lane   |
| 8659 | fish lap    |
| 3825 | muff rail   |

There isn't an obvious narrative, here, but we get better
by starting with "fish" (picturesque and smelly) and working
some sound-alikes backwards:

| 4716 | rack DASH | Take a fishing rod off the RACK and DASH   |

You can recall this the credit-card number weeks after devising
the story, without refreshing your memory in between. Devising it
took less than a minute. I instantly memorized it while devising
it without extra effort because I know the entire 2-digit peg
table by heart.

** Example GUID:

Hex is only a little harder than decimal.
Consider this random GUID generated by Java:

#+begin_example
5D00E7AA-C15C-44A5-93FA-A4DE6750B28A
#+end_example

Start with the pegs:

| =5D00 E7AA= | law chef sauce chip key jail jail |
| =C15C=      | chalk tail chalk                  |
| =44A5=      | rear jail law                     |
| =93FA=      | beam case jail                    |
| =A4DE 675=  | jail ray chef chip chuckle        |
| =0B28 A=    | saw judge Navy jail               |

*Note*:

- Encode 6750 as "chuckle saw," not as 67 50 "chalk lace."
  "Chalk" decodes as C, not as 67.

In the credit-card example, we worked backwards from the
picturesque peg "fish" 86. Here we work backwards from the
seductive sound-alike "naive" 28. The seductive emotion will make
it easier to memorize. Hallucinate a "hell-chef sauce," a recipe
for a naive victim.

| =5D00 E7AA= | HELL-chef SAUCE: CHOP, HACK, and CHILL the JELLY. |
| =C15C=      | SHAKE with TALLOW, CHECK                          |
| =44A5=      | the RARE CHILI OIL.                               |
| =93FA=      | "BE-MY HAGGIS, JILL!"                             |
| =A4DE 675=  | CHILL for an HOUR, SHAVE, CHOP, CHUCKLE.          |
| =0B28 A=    | "ASSAY, JUDGE!" NAIVE JILL.                       |

\clearpage
** Example SHA-1 Hash

From https://onlinehashtools.com, consider the following, 160-bit
hash: For git, it practically suffices to remember the first 8
hexits. Let's do them all as a workout:

| =A638 1B63= | jail camel tea judge chime     |
| =D532 69BA= | chef lemon jaw pea judge jail  |
| =418E 5FB1= | artful chip law case judge tea |
| =BD50 3950= | judge chef wholesome pillows   |
| =860D D679= | fishes chef chef checkup       |

*Notes*

- "Chime" for 63 is ok in hex and R36, but not ok in R64, where it
  decodes as "/".

- Don't encode 69 as "chip," rather as "jaw pea," because "chip"
  decodes as E.

- An alternative to "wholesome pillows" for 50 3950 is "lace map
  lace," but it's clumsy.

Let's bribe a judge and put him to sleep with hash (puns help the
memory), then summon middle-Eastern heavenly dreams.

| =A638 1B63= | with SHAWL and CAMEL, TEA for the JUDGE, JIM. |
| =D532 69BA= | SHAVE a LEMON WEDGE, PAY the JUDGE to CHILL.  |
| =418E 5FB1= | an ARTFUL SHAPE of this LAW CASE, SHUSH THEE! |
| =BD50 3950= | HASHISH ACHIEVES ELYSIUM BLESSINGS            |
| =860D D679= | FETCHES the CHIEF, JEHOVAH for JACOB!         |

* Radix 36

Radix-36 is more difficult to find "in the wild" than is either
hex or Radix-64. I most often see it in randomly generated file
and directory names because some file systems are not
case-sensitive. R36 is also found sometimes in URLs for encoding
queries or other data. HTTP is supposed to be case-sensitive, but
some sites don't adhere to the standard. Radix-64 is overkill in
such circumstances and sucks up alternatives.

For encoding /rixits/ in R36 (or biscuits in base-36?), I use
ASCII pegs for the capital letters beyond hex. Find their
sound-alikes in Section [[all-pegs]]. R36 is case-insensitive, by
design, so we only need one set of pegs. For Radix-64, we need
both upper and lower case. The stars in the table below mark
pegs for the lower case. They help for remembering the ASCII pair
--- upper and lower case --- but they're only pertinent for R64
(Section [[r64]]).

Pegs, first, converting to upper-case:

| =CEB= | chalk chip judge |
| =K9=  | coal pea         |

Do some forensics on a dead pet.

** Example from Spack

Spack (https://spack.io/) is a dependency solver for software
build systems. It produces directory names in R36 that won't
(statistically) collide with SHA-1 hashes and work fine on
case-insensitive file systems. Here's an example

#+end_example

Pegs first, except cheat on pronounceable subsequences or others
that appeal to your personal memory!

| =K5K5 HBAW= | coal law coal law, can judge jail fig       |
| =JAYW B4MV= | JAY fig, BEFORE MOVIE (judge ray cake fish) |
| =4R72 OSNQ= | ray fan key Noah, face fame cuff fat.       |

How about a tale of canceling on social media?

| =4R72 OSNQ= | OUR FAN GUY NOAH, with VOICE FAIR, GIVE FIGHT!       |

*Notes*

- "Car" for 74 is not ok because it decodes as "J". Peg it as "key
  ray," then try sound-alikes.

- "Fish" is "V" in R36, not 86. If we had 86, peg it as "fee jaw,"
  then try sound-alikes.

- 72 can't be "can," because that's "H" in R36. Peg it as "key
  Noah" then try sound-alikes.

Don't bother encoding AAAA, which precede and follow a canonical
prefix of 16 rixits for (supposedly) a machine-specific part of

get the required 68 rixits. We have 60 rixits to encode.

* Passwords

Don't make passwords easy for bots to guess. Random, long passwords
are best, but hard to remember, even with our systems. They're
even more difficult to associate uniquely with a web site.

Modern web sites don't store your passwords in the clear.
Virtually all, nowadays, hash your password with a one-way hash
(and usually some salt and a nonce challenge). That means you
expose nothing by re-using part of a password, so long as it's
different from site-to-site.

Pick a difficult prefix, but memorable to you. Mix in a special
character and a numeral because many sites insist on such. Start
with something picturesque:

"An Octopus has eight legs with suckers."

Now, partially encode and obfuscate it; this is your personal salt
prefix:

=2Octopu$Ha$8Leg$With0740=

Finally, append the site name, perhaps obfuscated:

* Daily Practice: ASCII,  Cards, NATO, Hebrew, Dates
<<daily-practice>>

Table 1 exploits the coincidence that there are 52 glyphs in the
ASCII Latin alphabet, 52 cards in a standard pack, and 52 weeks of
the year. There are only 22 Hebrew letters, so the last four rows
of each 26 are empty in the Hebrew column.

Table 1 is in groups of 13 corresponding to the suits of playing
cards. Each group also contains dates in a fortuitous quarterly
month-week pattern of 5-4-4: 5 weeks in Jan, 4 in Feb, 4 in Mar,
etc. The first days of the months are in the easy pattern 155,
274, 263, 153. You may memorize this as a honeymoon tale of
TAILLIGHTS, NIAGRA, UNASHAMED, HOTELMAN. Table 2 focuses on some
hallucinations specifically for dates.

These are for non-leap years only, so not great for computing
day-of-the-week. I have another method for that (debugged Furst)
in Section [[day-of-week]].

My daily practice includes another $156==3\times{}52=2\times{}78$
three columns of hallucinations for the 156 faces of a standard
Tarot pack, obverse and reverse. See Section [[tarot]].

I go down table 1 in my mind when I need to fall asleep. I usually
get four or five rows before drifting off, so next time through, I
start up where I left off. Sometimes, I recite it backwards just
to make sure the end of the table doesn't get soft from lack of
repetition.

* Tarot
<<tarot>>
Tarot cards have vivid imagery and powerful, emotional associated
words. Such features are great for memory.

There are 78 Tarot cards in a standard Rider-Waite pack. That's
not divisible by 52, but if we consider the reverse images
(upside-down cards) as distinct to the obverse, and most
cartomancers do, then we have 156 image-word combinations, and
that is divisible by 52. Thus, we get an additional three columns
of picture words to add to the daily practice ([[daily-practice]]),
where we associate them with standard playing cards, the NATO
alphabet, the ASCII codes, weeks of the year, day of the year, and
Hebrew words.

The Tarot suits are wands, clubs, swords, and pentacles. These are
obviously related to the suits of a standard pack, but different
enough that we'll just keep those two sets of suits distinct in
our minds. There are 14 cards in each suit, but only 22 trumps,
aka majors. Let's take the Knights out of each suit and append
them to the majors so that the minor suits have 13 cards each,
including three court cards --- page (like "jack"), queen, and

* APPENDICES
** Pegs and Hallucinations

I blogged out the basics of my peg method here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/memory-pegs/

** Sound-Alikes

Finding a sound-alike is "computing" or "calculating" a picture
word. For example, the peg for 37 is "mike." Picture a microphone
in your hand and feel the electrical tingling. Adding synaesthesia
or emotion to pegs helps my memory. It may not help other people.
Do what is best for you!

To calculate some nearby picture words, I get

- mica :: Glittering stone; feel grit on your fingers.

- mug :: A big cold beer.

- muck :: Smell the barnyard.

- Mecca :: Picture the kaaba and the pilgrims circulating.

- hammock :: Take a snooze.

** Building and Revising Chains

Take time building hallucinations so that ideas flow. It's bad to
have a break part-way-through, causing a pause or failure in
recall. You must be /fast/ and /accurate/. A break or even a soft
link in a chain is cause for starting over and building a new
chain.

** One Peg Set, Forever

Choose pegs that work for you, then */NEVER CHANGE THEM/*. Recall
must be instantaneous. Whenever you see or think of a number, you
must recall the peg without effort.

I regret changing a few pegs once. I did it for teaching purposes
because my originals got dated. For example, 3 for "May" became
"me" because no one today knows what a May-pole is. Every time I
see 3, however, I picture a May-pole instead of myself in a
mirror. I learned May-pole first (from Furst and from my Dad). The
switch slows me down even though I made the switch long, long ago.

*DON'T CHANGE PEGS AFTER LOCKING THEM IN*

Here is the GUID, again.

#+begin_example
5D00E7AA-C15C-44A5-93FA-A4DE6750B28A
#+end_example

How about a pseudo-poem about wildlife:

| =5D00E=  | OWL of WISDOM and SASSY STARING eyes.        |
| =7AA=    | HAWK, look SIDEWAYS left and SIDEWAYS right. |
| =C15C44= | STAND TALL, SUDDEN HARRIER                   |
| =A5=     | and ASSIDUOUS OWL!                           |
| =93FA=   | PUMA, STEALthy CITIZEN,                      |
| =DE6750= | STAMP! STRIKE! SHAKE, LASSIE!                |
| =B28A=   | Don't HESITATE. ENOUGH, CITIZEN!             |

*** Hex Method 2
<<hex-method-2>>

Another technique for hex is to exclusively use the single-word
pegs TOES-TISSUE $[10..15]$ for the hexits $[A..F]$. For decimal
digits that spell in 10-15, use two 1-digit pegs. For example,
don't spell 15 as TALL; that's for F exclusively. Spell it as TOE
EEL or some such.

Here we go, pegs, first:

| =5D00E7AA=     | law tam sauce tar key toes toes           |
| =C15C=         | tan tea tail tan                          |
| =44A5=         | rear toes law                             |
| =93FA=         | beam tail toes                            |
| =A4DE6750B28A= | toes ray tam tar chalk lace tot reef toes |

Ignore 'ing' in the following, wherein we are assaulted by a
Scottish traffic cop:

| =5D00E7AA=     | A Scottish policeman (LAW) wearing a TAM o'Shanter gives |
|                | me SASS. Pulls me over on the TARmac and demands my KEY. |
|                | I TOSS it on his TOES.                                   |
|                |                                                          |
| =C15C=         | "DONE IT WELL, laddie!"                                  |
|                |                                                          |
| =44A5 93FA A4= | THEN ROARING, "'TIS LOW, you BUM!                        |
|                | 'TILL he EATS TAZER!'"                                   |
|                |                                                          |
| =DE6750B28A=   | "DAMN TAR! SHAKE LESS! TIGHT ENOUGH  on my TOES!"        |

Method 1 produces more compact hallucinations and extends to higher
radices.

*** SHA-1 by Hex Method 1

#+begin_example
a638 1b63 d532 69ba 418e

Using Method 1, ignore common grammatical suffixes like "-ing" and
"-ful;" prepositions like "to" and "of;" pronouns and relative
adjective,words like "this," and "that;" forms of the verb "to
be," and other obvious connector words like "the" and "a."

Let's take a look at a statue in the artist's studio:

** Alternatives for Radix-64
<<public-keys>>

*** Methods 1 and 2, Again

A method-1 ([[hex-method-1]]) encoding of rixits, reserving 010
through 064, follows:

#+begin_example
0       8 010   016     024     032     040     048     056    063
v       v v     v       v       v       v       v       v      v
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/
#+end_example

**** Advantages of this encoding:

- There are so many picturesque words in English that begin with S
  that we have a deep well to draw from.

- The code for a letter is its numerical value in R64: $A=10,
  O=24$, etc.

  - Disadvantage of this advantage: we're working on memory, not
    on evaluation, so maybe this feature isn't so interesting.

**** Problems with this encoding:

***** Off-By-One Mental Arithmetic

Notice that 24 is "O," but you may remember that "O" is also the
15-th capital glyph of the alphabet. Adding 10 for the first ten
digits of the encoding, $15+A = 15+10 = 25$", not 24. This is an
opportunity for error at speed. But we can deal with it.

To encode O, remembered as the 15-th letter of the alphabet,
first subtract 1 to correct the off-by-one error, getting 14.
Then add 10 to account for the leading ten digits $0..9$ of the
encoding, getting 24. Prepend the leading $s=0$ for the radix to
get $024$, say "sunrise."

Encode: subtract 1, add 10, i.e., add 9.

*/Encode: enhance nine./*

$O\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}024\rightarrow{}\textrm{sunrise}$.

To decode $\textrm{sunrise}=024$, remove the leading $s=0$ to
get 24. Subtract 10 to get 14. Add 1 to get 15, the 15-th
capital letter.

Decode: add 1, subtract 10, i.e., subtract 9.

*/Decode: deduct nine./*

$\textrm{sunrise}\rightarrow{}024\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}O$.

For small letters, add and subtract 26.

$o\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}41\rightarrow{}50\rightarrow{}050\rightarrow{}\textrm{solstice}$.

$\textrm{solstice}\rightarrow{}050\rightarrow{}50\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}15$ in lower case.

It's a lot of mental arithmetic, but that's fun, too. Balance
the fun factor against the need for recall speed and accuracy.
\newpage
***** ASCII Popups

If you've memorized ASCII, you already have pegs for A-Z and a-z.
They will pop up at speed. You can either force them away; use
them as with Method 2 above, accepting the trade-off risk of
collisions and ambiguity, or go with ASCII in my first method.

*** Structure in Public Keys
<<key-structure>>

Generating another public key on my machine, notice that the
first 6 quads, 24 Rixits, 64 bits each, 1536 bits, are the same in
the two keys:

#+begin_example
ssh-ed25519
AAAA C3Nz aC1l ZDI1 NTE5 AAAA  <~~~ for the machine?
IKWf n2B6 AjfK MNwX +Ekt d7mx
nhwi GALP JfEO oEwk 2X/u
#+end_example

By induction, assume without confirmation or authority that the
first 24 Rixits are for the machine and $11\times{}4=44$ Rixits
for the rest. That's 2816 bits.

The total is 4352 bits, or 68 Rixits, consistent with this
article:

https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54

That's it for cross-checking; on to memorization.

Let's tell a tale of poisoning an indiscreet lover.

*** The Supposed Machine Prefix.
<<machine-prefix>> Don't bother with the leading and trailing
=AAAA=, assuming they're always present (TODO: check that!),
leaving =C3Nz aC1l ZDI1 NTE5=:

| =C3Nz= | SATIN HEM in a CINEMAtic SASH-WEIGHT                  |
| =aC11= | SMOOCH - STAINED, a HOT OATH                          |
| =ZDI1= | a SMALL STEAMing from the STOVE, with TEA brewing     |
| =NTE5= | CYANAMIDE for a SNOBbish SUITOR's ALE                 |

*** The Unique Parts
<<unique-parts>>
Now in groups of 3 or 4 quads:

| =IFi4= | STUFF the STILL for his ZERO-HOUR HURRAH     |
| =CpLS= | SWEETEN the SALT with a SCENT of SNUFF       |
| =hSK/= | a SERUM SINFUL and SINISTER for his SASHIMI  |
| =uUux= | a SOLUTION SEMISWEET, no SLUDGE in this SLOP |
|        |                                              |
| =BxMe= | SATED, he SLIPS into ASSONANT WHIMsies       |
| =6WwK= | HUSHed SOMNOLENCE, SOULFUL SNOOZing          |
| =C6RD= | SATIN HUSH, SNUG STOMACH                     |
| =1Qn/= | DIE, SWITCHMAN! SNATCH CERBERUS              |

| =BV3m= | SEDATED, to the CEMETERY HOME, SERF!         |
| =pUZq= | SLIDE into OSMOSIS, ASSIMILATE SLAIN!        |

*** Old Old Method
<<old-old-method>>

I blogged out a more trivial method, similar to method 2 for GUIDs
some time ago:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/memorizing-in-base-64/

This method maps the rixits directly to the pegs. The mental
arithmetic is the same as above: computing a peg number from
characters A..Z and a..z by adding 9 and-or-26. We just lose the
leading S, so we lose some richness to the vocabulary.

*** Radix-64 Method 3
<<method-3>>
Another method, which I have not tried, is to map the alphabetic
letters to their S-enhanced letter numbers, as in

| A   |  01 |
| B   |  02 |
| ... | ... |
| Z   | 026 |
| a   | 027 |
| b   | 028 |
| ... | ... |
| z   | 052 |

The decimal digits go to their regular pegs, 0..9. This is a
variation of the old-old-method ([[old-old-method]]).

** Memorizing Dates

For most kids, history class is torture because of the need to
memorize dates. But that's a snap with the peg system. I still
remember from 11-th grade that

RAY TAN CHAT

was the beginning day of the Civil War, because you burned me with
a RAY gun and that ended the peace talks. April 12, 1861.

** Memorizing a Shuffled Card Pack
<<card-pack>>
I blogged this out in December, 2010, starting here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/take-the-diamonds/

Here is a scrape of the relevant blog posts.

*** Take the Diamonds

Do you smell machine oil the instant you see the Diamond Queen from a
pack of cards? How about cigarette smoke when you see the Diamond Six,
or baby powder when you see the Diamond Ace? Read on . . .

Take the entire suit of Diamonds out of a pack of cards and lay them out
in order, from Ace to King, in front of you on a table. Notice that the
word “diamond” begins with a D, and recall that the consonant sound D
stands for the number 1 -- or for the digit “1” in combination with
other digits, as we have been using it so far. Think of the suit,
diamonds, as the tens digit in combination with the plain digit of each
card. Then the diamond Ace will be 11 -- 1 for the tens digit from
“diamonds” and 1 for the Ace itself, since it's the first card in the
suit. The Ace through the Nine come out with no problem at all and they
hook up immediately with our memorized, permanent pegs. As you go
through the list below, really take some time to stare at the card and
visualize the mental picture right on the face of the card. If the deck
is one you can write on or draw on, draw a little cartoon or write the
picture word on the face of the card. You'll be using these cards to
help you lock in the pegs:

| /Card/ | /Num/ | /Peg/  | /Mental Picture/                                        |
|--------+-------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| D A    |    11 | tot    | Alice from Alice in Wonderland.                         |
|        |       |        | Smell baby-powder in the air.                           |
| D 2    |    12 | tan    | Someone tanning herself holding a reflective            |
|        |       |        | tray under her chin. Smell tanning oil.                 |
| D 3    |    13 | tam    | A tam-o-shanter tartan cap with red pom-pom on the head |
|        |       |        | of a Scottish warrior in full kilts. Smell heather.     |
| D 4    |    14 | tar    | A sizzling hot stretch of deserted highway,             |
|        |       |        | so hot the tar is sticky. Smell the tar, too.           |
| D 5    |    15 | tail   | The orange-and-black striped tail of an enormous tiger. |
|        |       |        | Imagine a zoo smell.                                    |
| D 6    |    16 | tissue | Someone wiping tears from her eyes after remembering    |
|        |       |        | an emotional event. Smell cigarette smoke and think     |
|        |       |        | of the song “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.”                  |
| D 7    |    17 | tack   | A huge thumbtack or map-pin holding something on a      |
|        |       |        | big cork board. Smell fresh ink and paper.              |
| D 8    |    18 | taffy  | A big blob of hot, sweet-smelling pink and green taffy  |
|        |       |        | candy, stuck to your fingers getting all over the card. |
| D 9    |    19 | tap    | A beer tap spilling beer all over the card, splashing   |
|        |       |        | on your clothes and making a smelly mess.               |
|        |       |        |                                                         |

Notice I've added smell to the associations, and even a song. We can
really take this idea far and involve taste and touch over all the pegs,
and we may do that in the future -- it will be an interesting exercise.
This is one of the things that Eran Katz suggests to do in his books
(highly recommended), and since smell works very well for my personal
memory, I'm adding it to my permanent inventory and inviting you along
for this addition.

We have only four cards to go. The diamond 10 is pretty easy -- I'm just
going to pick the peg “toes” and picture the woman painting her toenails
all different colors. And the smell? Toenail Polish! Easy.

And for the last three, let's promote the 1 to the hundreds digit and
sneak in some three-digit pegs (from the third layer -- a preview).
Notice we may have some extra consonant sounds on the ends of the
three-digit pegs. They're throw-aways, because the system doesn't go to
four or more digits at a time. 1,110 permanent pegs is quite enough!

| /Card/ | /Num/ | /Peg/      | /Mental Picture/                                 |
|--------+-------+------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| D J    |   111 | teetotaler | Picture a prissy little man with ill-fitting     |
|        |       |            | clothes, a crooked bow tie, thick eyeglasses     |
|        |       |            | and a pocket protector pontificating on the      |
|        |       |            | virtues of total abstinence from alcohol.        |
|        |       |            | Smell Lysol (too much cleaning)                  |
| D Q    |   112 | titan      | Picture an enormous robot with rivets all over   |
|        |       |            | its shell. Smell machine oil and steel.          |
| D K    |   113 | totem      | Picture a Native-American totem pole with        |
|        |       |            | effigies of bears, salmon, and a huge, winged    |
|        |       |            | eagle on top.                                    |
|        |       |            | Smell a campfire and the wood of the totem pole. |

That's it. Take your suit of diamonds along with you, pull it out and
practice the visualization and imaginary smelling exercise whenever you
find yourself having to kill time. Just a few times over this and you
won't need the cards any more. You will INSTANTLY smell and see taffy
when you think of the Diamond-8. The Diamond Queen will INSTANTLY bring
to mind the smell of machine oil and steel. And vice versa, and through
the entire suit.

tar (14 = D4). Across the highway, a six-foot tall beer

tap (19 = D9) is gushing beer onto the tarmac. The beer boils on
contact, releasing a strong beer smell, and runs gently downhill into a
grid of huge, multicolored

tacks (17 = D7) pushed into the tarmac. These tacks are also piercing
and holding down a tiger's

tail (15 = D5), and the tiger is roaring in pain and licking a huge lump
of pink-and-green alcoholic

taffy (18 = D8) by the other side of the road from Alice to soothe his
pain. In front of the tiger, a

teetotaler (111 = DJ), specially summoned from AA for the situation, is
wagging his finger at the tiger and delivering a stern warning about the
evils of alcoholic taffy. The other hand of the teetotaler is exposed to
the hot sun and is getting quite a

tan (12 = D2). With that overtanning hand, he is holding the right hand
of a steel robot

titan (112 = Q2) who is wagging his head, clicking and beeping, emitting
the odor of machine oil, and, with his other hand, painting his

toenails (toes = 10 = D10) and also the toenails of the

totem (113 = DK) standing right next to him (smell the toenail polish).
The top of the totem is obscured by a huge

tam-o-shanter (13 = D3), which is baking in the hot sun and emitting a
strong smell of roasting wool

Now, I came up with this phantasmagoria yesterday morning in less than
one minute, I did not think about it all day, the day was very, very
busy with other activities, I went out for a couple of drinks after
work, slept through the night, and didn't think of this for a whole 24
hours until just now. I remembered it almost perfectly (I forgot the
tacks, and all that means is that I didn't form the mental picture
vividly enough -- I had the tiger's tail threaded around the tacks, but
I recommended to you to imagine the pins pushed THROUGH the tail, adding
the roaring and pain to the phantasmagoria). If I had been more careful,
I would have remembered it perfectly.

Think about this: by exploiting the visual imagination and dragging in
all the other senses -- feeling the heat, smelling the smells, hearing
the sounds, I was able to remember 24 hours later, after a minute of
looking, a shuffled suit of cards (and, if I had been more careful, I
would have remembered it perfectly!). When I am in practice, I can
memorize an entire shuffled deck in 2 minutes, while you deal them out
(I'll teach you the other suits later, while we go through the second
layer of the memory system). When I am out of practice, 4 minutes is
plenty. Even better, I can memorize 39 of the cards and then tell you
the remaining 13 cards just by running down the suits in my mind and
naming the cards that aren't in my phantasmagoria. I can even do it
tomorrow from yesterday's shuffle.

This is a great party trick. The pros can do this really fast. The
athletes in the world memory championships
([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Memory_Championships]]) can do it
in less than 30 seconds, and they can memorize the order of 8 shuffled
decks in 15 minutes.

Try this. You will amaze yourself. Then, think of practical
applications.

*** The 40s and Hearts

Back with the 10's we learned pegs to memorize a shuffling of the
diamond suit, in any order. This time, we'll learn pegs for the 40's and
for the hearts suit. The reason to associate hearts with the 40's is
that the first important consonant in ‘hearts' is ‘r,' a digit 4, which
we promote to the number 40 for the application of memorizing cards.
Here are my permanent pegs for the 40's. As always, feel free to tailor
this set to your own memory style

Those pegs cover the playing cards Heart Ace (41) through Heart Ten
(40). We need three more for the face cards

Heart Jack: 411, rat-a-tat-tat; picture a machine gun; you're carrying
it and shooting it at things

Heart Queen: 412, rattan; picture white wicker furniture

Heart King: 413, radium; picture the item-to-remember pulsing with the
(imaginary) green glow of radioactive radium.

Pick the diamonds and the hearts out of a pack of cards, shuffle them,
and prepare to memorize the order. Take your time: don't rush it. Go for
accuracy. The speed will come naturally with practice. Here's an example
of a run I did just now, building this story in my mind in real time. If
you follow along and build the miniature movie in your mind, you will no
trouble recalling the order of the cards. Take special effort to chain
the pegs one to another (yes, this is a combined application of
chain-memory and peg-memory):

(D2) I'm outside in the hot sun getting a */tan/*, but I'm really
burning and it hurts

(H5) There's a tropical drink station on the beach and there is a very
prominent brass */rail/* where I want to rest my feet while I order a
cool drink, but I can't quite reach it with my feet

(HQ) I sit in a stool made of white */rattan/*; hear the distinctive
creaking sound as you sit and try to reach the rail with your feet

(H3) Sitting next to me is a guy holding on to the reins of his riding
*/ram/* and the ram is chewing the rattan (this is an important
connection as it's easy to forget the rattan without making the ram do
something with it)

(H10) he pulls out of his pocket a scale model of a NASCAR */race/*
track and places it on the counter, and the cars start going around

(DA) Alice from Wonderland (a */tot/*) walks up to take a look at the
model race track

(DK) she puts a pint-sized */totem/* pole right in the middle of the
oval racetrack

(HJ) one of the effigies in the totem has a machine gun in its hand and
starts shooting at the cars (rat-a-tat-tat)

(H4) many of the cars are Corvettes with their distinctive */rear/* ends
(four circular red lights, 2-by-2). The bullets are shooting out the red
lights

(DJ) a teetotaler comes up to us at the tropical bar and lectures on the
violent side-effects of drinking alcohol, using the machine-gunning
totem as evidence

(H7) he points to a */rack/* of antlers mounted on the wall of the
tropical bar as further evidence: the hunter must have been drinking to
go after such a huge caribou

(D9) we all laugh and him and order the bartender to pull us more beers
from the */tap/*

(H8) some divers out in the */reef/* hear the sound of the enormous beer
tap pouring beer and pop their heads out of the waves and shout at us to
pour some for them, too

(D3) we notice that some of the divers are wearing */tam/*-o-shanters
over their dive helmets

(D5) tigers (with orange-and-black striped */tails/*) run along the
beach into the waves and snatch the tam-o-shanters in their jaws.

(D6) they run a big circle over toward us, stop and wipe tears from
their eyes (with */tissues/*) out of regret for stealing the
tam-o-shanters

(H2) all of a sudden, it clouds over and a driving, tropical rain soaks
the weeping tigers with tams in their teeth and pounds on the roof of
the tropical drink station

(HK) the weather radio in the back of the bar starts to blare news at a
high volume about the storm and pulse very brightly with green
*/radium/* glow

(HA) huge black */rats/* scurry out from behind the bar, scared out by
the sudden noise of the radio -- see the radium glistening on their
greasy, rain-soaked fur

(D4) the rats run all the way out to the */tar/*mac in the parking lots
near the beach, and the hot tar is steaming from the sudden rain; the
rats are jumping on the hot tar

(D8) they run over to piles of hot green and white */taffy/* piled up in
one corner of the tarmac and start eating it voraciously

(D10) on top of the piles of taffy are young women painting their
*/toe/*nails -- yes, in the driving rain -- and dripping the toenail
polish on the taffy

(D7) the toenail polish is running down the taffy and flowing around the
shafts of enormous thumb*/tack/*s embedded in the base of the piles of
taffy

(H6) under each thumbtack is a doctor's prescription for */rash/*
medication; it's going to help with all the sunburns we got

(H9) tied to each prescription is a burlap */rope/* (don't know where
this is going, yet, but just tie them up

(DQ) at the other end of each rope is a */titan/*, a robot, pulling on
the rope

That's it -- now close your eyes and run through the movie in your mind,
and the cards will play out in order. Try not to go back and peek. If
you have to do that, it means that you didn't form a sufficiently strong
association linking one mental picture with the next. Practice will make
perfect!

tan, rail, rattan, ram, race, tot (Alice), totem, ratatattat, rear
(shooting out the Corvette brake lights) teetotaler, rack, tap, reef,
tam, tail, tissue, rain, radium, rat, tar, taffy, toes, tack, rash,
rope, titan

D2, H5, HQ, H3, H10, DA, DK, HJ, H4, DJ, H7, D9, H8, D3, D5, D6, H2, HK,
HA, D4, D8, D10, D7, H6, H9, DQ

I had to really work hard to recall rattan and rear, which means I
didn't form the connected images strongLY enough first time around.
practice practice practice.

*** The 70s and Clubs

By now, you know the drill. The 70's are another decade in the regular
peg list of the second layer of the system. Just as the 10's stand for
the diamonds (because the ‘D' of ‘diamond' is a sound for 1, and 1 is
the first digit of each visual memory word for the diamond suit), and
the 40's stand for hearts (because the ‘R' of ‘heaRts' is a 4-sound),
the 70's stand for the club suit. You will get three bonus visual-words
from the third layer for the Jack, Queen, and King of clubs. Practice
with the club suit alone, locking in the visual words, then mix in the
hearts and diamonds. You will be able to memorize a shuffled pack of
these 39 cards and impress yourself. Without further ado, here is my
list:

*** The 90s and Spades

This is the last set of ten, permanent peg words in the second layer of
the system, with three bonus words from the third layer so we can
memorize the last suit of a card deck, the spades. Every number in the
90's begins with the digit 9, and the consonant cluster for 9 is B and
P. The word “Spade” encodes to 091; ignore the leading zero and pick the
9=P to stand for the spades, so the spades will come from the 90's. In
later blogs, we'll summarize the entire second layer, add a couple of
odds and ends, and work on applications like card tricks.

** Calculating Day of the Week
<<day-of-week>>

I blogged this out here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/590/

Here is an edited scrape:

Remember Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie “Rainman,” who can
instantly say the day of the week for a given date? Of course, he was
an autistic savant and probably didn't know and certainly couldn't teach
how he does it, but here is a method I learned from my Dad [Furst
has the same method].

Preliminaries:

Do all math mod 7, that is, you only need to keep the remainder of the
results of any calculation after dividing by 7. Thus, 15 is 1, 33 is 5,
49 is 0, etc.

Every day of the week has a number, starting with 1 for Sunday and
ending with 0 for Saturday. Your goal is to convert any Gregorian
calendar date into such a number.

Jan and Feb belong to the year BEFORE. The reason is that leap years add
a day at the end of Feb and it makes all the math easier to think that
Jan and Feb 1963 are really part of 1962, for example. Also remember
that the Romans started their year with the month of March. Maybe it
was for a similar reason.

Example:

29 Nov 1872.

First convert the century. 1900 happens to be a 0, so that's
really really easy and convenient. The numbers for all other
centuries go in a cycle 6 4 2 0, which is also really easy to
remember: “AGES RUN IN SEQUENCE.” Because 1900 is 0, 2000 is 6,
2100 will be 4, 2200 will be 2, etc. 1800 is 2.

Keep 2 in your head and move forward.

Now convert the year, and there are two steps. First, the year mod 7
because each year is one day longer than a multiple of 7, namely 364. 72
mod 7 is 2. Add 2 to the 2 we're carrying to get 4 so far.

Now get the number of leap years in the century. That's 72 / 4, or
18 discarding the remainder; that's 4. Add it to the 4 we're
keeping, which is 8, which is 1.

Now get the month. Here are mnemonics for months:

| Mar | Irish         | 4 | St. Patrick's Day                 |
| Apr | Easter        | 0 |                                   |
| May | National      | 2 | Memorial Day                      |
| Jun | Altar         | 5 | Lots of weddings in June          |
| Jul | Sun or Summer | 0 | First full sunny month of summer  |
| Aug | Moon          | 3 | Start seeing harvest moons in Aug |
| Sep | Job           | 6 | Labor Day                         |
| Oct | Travel        | 1 | Columbus Day                      |
| Nov | Restaurant    | 4 | Eat turkey in a restaurant        |
| Dec | Church        | 6 | Christmas in a church             |
| Jan | New           | 2 | New-Year's Day                    |
| Feb | Love          | 5 | St. Valentine's Day               |

If you forget one, you can recalculate a month number by just adding up
the 30 = 2 and 31 = 3 days from the beginning of the year in March (mod
7, of course). The day counts for the months go like this:
32323/32323/30, nice easy pattern, or you can sing the “30 days hath
September, April, June, and November” ditty if you prefer. Whatever
works.

We're carrying a 1 in head. Add a 4 for Nov, giving 5. Almost done.

29 mod 7 is 1; add our 5, we get 6. 29 Nov 1872 was a Friday.

Do this a few times and check yourself against Google or
timeanddate.com.  You'll make a few mistakes when getting started, but
after a little while you'll be able to do it quickly and reliably.

Let's try today, 21 May 2022:

#+begin_verse
2000 = 6
22 = 1 += 0
ly = 22/4 = 5 discarding the remainder
May = 2 += 7 = 0
21 = 0 += 0
#+end_verse

Today is Saturday.

* All Pegs and Sound-Alikes
<<all-pegs>>

Letters for hex, ASCII, and R36, R64 alternative methods are
included in the row headers.

TODO: My personal permanent peg words are first in each block and
in all-caps. My short-list of preferred sound-alikes are in the
first row of each table.

I don't (yet) have a memorized peg for every number, just for the
most useful ones. It takes time to come up with good pegs. It's a
quadratic process because I pick pegs that don't collide visually
with the ones I already have. Picking a new peg means thinking
about all the others picked so-far. I already have CHAIR for 64
(used all the time), so SEAT for 01 and THRONE for 142 are not
good ideas because they might incorrectly recall 64 at speed.

* COMMENT Mental Hash Functions

John D. Cook recently blogged about Manuel Blum's proposed hash
function that can be computed mentally:

      r"""Map a character to a random number in [0..9]."""
      ch = ch.lower()
      return fdata[ord(ch) - ord('a')]
  gdata = rng.permutation(10)
  print({"permutation": gdata})
  def g(n):
      r"""Get from gdata the character after
      the given one, wrapping. This permutation
      has no fixed points."""
      i = list(gdata).index(n % 10)
      result = gdata[(i+1) % 10]
      assert result != n
      return result
  def hash(text):

      out[0] = g(digits[0] + digits[-1])
      for i in range(1, N):
          out[i] = g(out[i-1] + digits[i])
      return "".join(str(d) for d in out)
