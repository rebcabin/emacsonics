* Prologue

Brian is the curator and primary author of this document. He wrote
the first version before enlisting John and Ondrej to contribute.
Any use of the first person "I," "we," and so on, in the document
is historical and refers to Brian. Brian is responsible for all
mistakes.

** How to Modify this Document

The PDF file is generated from =.org= source via Emacs. The org
source contains blocks of Clojure code, specifically calls of the
=babomorph= function, which extracts strings from the following
Clojure file:

=src/how-to-memorize/core.clj=.

If you want to change the peg words, the ordering of the words,
the capitalization of the words, the formatting of the tables in
the PDF document, or anything else about this code, modify that
=core.clj= file, =cider jack-in=, and evaluate the code via
=Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= while visiting =core.clj=. If you want to change
prose or other aspects of the document, modify the =.org= file
and you won't have to bother with =core.clj=.

The results of running all the Clojure code is cached in the
=.org= file. If you change the Clojure code, evaluate =core.clj=
via =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C=, then manually run affected blocks in the
=.org= file by removing the =:results:= blocks and keyboarding
=Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= (same command, just while visiting the =.org=
file) with your cursor somewhere inside the =begin_src= or
=babomorph= block.

For example, if you change the table for $00$ through $09$ in the
=core.clj= file, =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= in =core.clj=, then remove the
results drawer and its hash on that table here in the =.org=
file---it looks like this:

#+begin_example
#+RESULTS[7ecf5cbc3481e60410646e89bc93d7140a6cad17]:
:results:
|----+----------+---------+----------+----------+--------...
| 00 | SAUCE    | OASIS   | icehouse | sissy    | sass   ...
|    | assess   | assize  | houses   | sassy    | say-so ...
|    | seize    | size    |          |          |        ...
...
:end:
#+end_example

Delete all the results through the =:end:=.

Then keyboard =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= on the babomorph block, which looks
like this:

#+begin_example
#+begin_src clojure :cache yes :exports results :results ...
  (babomorph 0 10)
#+end_src
#+end_example

and you'll see the table regenerated.

Note that the =babomorph= commands are off-by-one-hundred, so
=(babomorph 510 520)= builds the table for pegs 410 through 419.
This is so we can accommodate pegs that begin with zero.

To produce the PDF, you need a full \LaTeX installation, Emacs
29.1 or later, Clojure 1.10.3 or better (see =project.clj=), and
CIDER installed. There may be other ways to build the PDF, but
that's what I use. Manually =cider-jack in= to a CIDER session to
warm up the Clojure environment. Run

=org-latex-export-to-pdf=

while visiting the =.org= file in an Emacs buffer to produce a
=.tex= file and possibly a =.pdf= file.

Something went wrong in my recent =tex= integration, so I run

=pdflatex -shell-escape how-to-memorize-hex-r36-r64.tex=

twice, manually in a side terminal after running

=org-latex-export-to-pdf=

but that's not a big roadblock. Your installation's of \LaTeX and
Emacs may go more smoothly.

The =.org= file contains lots of stuff that isn't output to the
PDF file. That stuff represents either work-in-progress or
variations on the main theme, variations that aren't good enough
to commit to print.

* Introduction

Here is a word that might be unfamiliar:

\label{def:phantasmagoria}
\begin{definition}
  A \emph{phantasmagoria} is

  1. a vivid mental image like Superman or Bilbo Baggins

  2. a mental movie clip like Rhett Butler carrying Scarlett O'Hara up
     the staircase, two steps at a time; or Legolas the elf
     in "Lord of the Rings" firing off arrows

  3. a sensation like the taste of cherry pie with vanilla ice cream or
     the smell of burnt motor oil in an old engine block

  4. a musical riff like Clapton's "Down to the Crossroads" or
     Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"

  5. anything else that's vivid and easy to recall without effort
\end{definition}

The premise of everything in this document is

\label{prm:premise}
\begin{premise}{}
  Almost everyone can recall phantasmagorias without effort.
  Let's trick our minds into memorizing numerical
  data via permanent associations between numbers and
   phantasmagorias.
  $\blacksquare$
\end{premise}

We'll find that we can memorize long sequences of numbers in any
radix (base) by making up phantasmagorias, or /phants/ for short.
It's fun, easy, and empowering. It requires some
effort up front, but the effort is incremental. It takes less than
30 minutes for anyone to learn how to memorize shopping lists of
up to 10 items effortlessly and without writing anything down. In
a couple of weeks, anyone can learn to memorize lists of up to 100
items effortlessly. That's good enough for a lifetime of
practical application. The seriously committed can spend a few
months learning to memorize up to 1110 items effortlessly.

# JDC proposes a general theory in Section [[gut-pegs]] that
# loosely explains the non-linear efforts for these constants, 10,
# 100, 1000.

* The Peg System, Contrasted

This document is primarily about the Mnemonic-Major or Peg
system,[fn::https://forum.artofmemory.com/t/the-mnemonic-major-system-and-gregg-shorthand-have-the-same-underlying-structure/26339][fn::
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system] which makes
/direct/ and permanent associations between numbers and permanent
phantasmagorias --- the /pegs/, then temporary phantasmagorias for
the memory task at hand. For example, in my realization of the
Major system, 1 is always and forever the peg TEA, 2 is NOAH,
3 is ME, and so on. To remember the temporary shopping list
"broccoli, grapes, lettuce," I picture a big, Disneyland teacup
overflowing with broccoli, Noah squishing grapes into his beard,
and me in the mirror with a head of lettuce instead of my actual
head, and so on. When I'm done with the shopping list, I mentally
discard it, but not the pegs. I reuse the pegs later for the next
task. The pegs are forever.

The famous Roman-Room
system[fn::https://artofmemory.com/blog/roman-rooms/], also called
/Memory Palace/ or /Method of Loci/, assigns temporary
phantasmagorias, for the memory task at hand, to permanent mental
images of favorite places that you mentally visit in sequence,
such as bedroom, bathroom, kitchen. When you want to remember the
shopping list "broccoli, grapes, lettuce," picture the broccoli in
the bedroom, grapes in the bathroom, lettuce in the kitchen, and
so on. If you have a big sequence of favorite places or /loci/, as
they're called, you can memorize big lists this way.

I prefer the peg system because I don't actually have a sequence
of favorite places that I can recall quickly and without effort.
But I can recall the pegs quickly and without effort, so they
do the job for me. Lots of people love the Roman-Room system
though, and I encourage you to develop it if it works for you. In
either case, the objective is to have a fixed sequence of mental
images on which you can hang temporary mental images, either to
just have a list or to make mental movies, etc.

The equally famous Person-Action-Object (PAO) system
[fn::https://artofmemory.com/blog/pao-system/] amplifies my
realization of the Major system, as explained in Appendix [[pao]].

My primary sources for the peg system are
Krill[fn::https://folk.ntnu.no/krill/pseudonumerology.htm]
and Furst.[fn::https://a.co/d/fv1uRmv/]. Krill calls his system
/Pseudonumerologic-VIP/, which is a clever way of remembering the
fundamental pegs 0123456789 by sound: =SDNMRLJKVP=.

These methods are based on tables of

- pegs :: permanent, immutable mental images in one-to-one
  correspondence with numbers. For instance, I pegged the number
  68 to /chef/. Whenever I see a chef or think of one, I smell the
  kitchen and hear the sounds of boiling and sizzling
  phantasmagorically, and instantly think of the number 68. That's
  1-to-1 correspondence.

- sound-alikes :: fluid, mutable lists of mental-images that are
  similar in their consonant sounds to the pegs and in many-to-one
  correspondence to the numbers. 68's CHEF sounds like CHIEF,
  SHEAF, JAVA, CHAFF, amongst others. While 68 always means CHEF,
  recalled instantly, a chef might not fit well into an ongoing
  phantasmagoria. For instance, if we're memorizing 276872, the
  pegs are NECK, CHEF, and CAN. That sequence does not invoke an
  obvious story or mental movie, so we start looking for
  sound-alikes. How about INCA CHIEF COIN? Just picture a coin
  with an Inca chief embossed on it, and we're done. It took a few
  seconds to derive INCA CHIEF COIN from NECK CHEF CAN, but the
  other direction is almost instantaneous. Sound-alikes are
  many-to-one because there are many words that map to each
  number.

The big point is this: you can instantly go from a number to a
peg, and you can, almost instantly, go from a sound-alike to a
number. It might take a little while to go from a peg to a
sound-alike, but if doing so helps memorize a big list, then it's
worth the effort.

# For radices beyond decimal, one choice is a mapping from
# alphanumeric glyphs to ASCII because I already have the mapping
# memorized (Section [[daily-practice]]). In appendices, I show some
# alternative mappings if you don't have ASCII memorized.

\clearpage
* Basic Pegs
<<basic-pegs>>

The pegs for the decimal digits are the fundamental foundation for
the entire system. All longer pegs, like CHEF for 68, are built
up from these. Here are my basic pegs, with some mnemonic hints:

|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
| digit | peg  | mnemonic                                   | sound-alike rules     |

|       |      | T looks like 1                             |                       |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|

|       |      | (2 = ng for Krill only, nk is always 27)   | "Krill" has 2 "l"s)   |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     3 | me   | ... in the mirror tying a bow tie;         |                       |
|       |      | M has 3 legs                               |                       |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     4 | ray  | laser pointer, flashlight, light saber     |                       |
|       |      | no simple mnemonic to 4                    |                       |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     5 | law  | 5 fingers as the cop holds up his hand     |                       |
|       |      | the hand is L-shaped as you look at it     |                       |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     6 | jaw  | 6 looks like Lurch's lantern jaw           | sh, ch, zh (pleasure) |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     7 | key  | 7 looks like an Allen key                  | g, ng (Furst only)    |
|       |      | (7 = ng for Furst and me, nk is always 27) |                       |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     8 | fee  | 8 looks like a dollar sign                 | f, v                  |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
|     9 | pea  | The Princess and the Pea: 9 mattresses     | p, b                  |
|-------+------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------|

Memorize this table, or one personalized to you, by whatever
means, by brute force if necessary. The rest of the system relies
on it. If you don't like these specific pegs, pick some others out
of the rows for 0 through 9 in Section [[all-pegs]]. Pick your own peg
for each digit, make your own table, memorize it, and stick with
it forever. NEVER, EVER CHANGE ANYTHING IN IT. Brian did that once
more than 50 years ago, and continues to regret it. This table
must become an internal, effortless vocabulary like your native
language.

Make up pegs and sound-alikes for longer numbers by combining
consonant sounds. For example, here is the peg and sound-alikes
for 32:

#+begin_src clojure :cache yes :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 132 133)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[c73f78f3ec40ebbcdf9733e33285918be30c387f]:
:results:
|----+-------+---------+--------+-------+------+--------|
| 32 | MAN   | MOON    | mane   | hymen | mine | minnow |
|    | amen  | ammonia | human  | main  | mana | mania  |
|    | manna | many    | mean   | mien  | moan | money  |
|    | omen  | woman   | yeoman |       |      |        |
:end:


*/Notes on such tables/*:

- the peg is in all-caps and in first position; other terms in
  all-caps are recommended alternative pegs; use them if they work
  better for you

- the first line contains preferred sound-alikes in preference
  order

- the remaining sound-alikes appear in alphabetical order

MAN is the peg: it is /equal/ to 32 in your mind. I visualize
Superman flying out of the phone booth, impossible to forget for me.

# The Sound-Alikes help to create longer phantasmagorias from longer
# strings of numbers by devising a story (though see Appendix [[pao]]).
# For instance, 327685 is Superman (32) leaping up to catch (76) a
# fly (85). With practice, one gets fast. Eran Katz often opens his
# lectures with a stunt wherein he memorizes hundreds of digits as
# quickly as the audience calls them out and his assistant writes
# them down.

** Old 3-Digit System

We go up to three digits in this document. That means that every
number from 00 through 099 and 0 through 1000 has a peg and a list
of sound-alikes.

In this old system, the peg and sound-alikes for the 3-digit
number $xyz$ are formed from 3 hard consonant sound alikes, $a$
for $x$, $b$ for $y$, and $c$ for $z$. For instance, here is the
list for $xyz=352$:

#+begin_src clojure :cache yes :exports results :results verbatim drawer output

#+end_src

| 352 | MELON  | Himalayans | hemline    | semolina   | milliner | homeland |
|     | malign | melancholy | millennial | millennium | million  |          |
:end:


When making up pegs and sound-alikes, weak consonant sounds such as
H, WH, Y, and W are free. For example, ignore the H in /hemline/. Use soft
consonants at will. Vowel sounds are also free --- use as many or
as few as you like.

From this point on, when we write "sound" or "sounds," we mean
"hard consonant sound" or "hard consonant sounds."

Ignore trailing sounds beyond the first three:
/hemline/ and /hemlining/ both encode 352, as do /millennial/ and
/millenium/.

Ignore leading S and Z sounds if the total number of sounds is
four or more. So /semolina/ encodes 352.

However, /semolina/ also
encodes 035 by the rule about trailing sounds beyond three. This
is a flaw in Furst's original design. Here is more about this
problem.

*** Leading S and Z sounds

Furst's tables are ambiguous for 3-digit pegs with leading 0, as
we show in this section. It's a major TODO to fix this problem.

The first general rule is:

#+begin_quote
/Ignore leading S and Z sounds when the total number of sounds is four or more./
#+end_quote

By this rule, /semolina/, which has four sounds, encodes 352, as
seen above. However, /semolina/ also appears in Furst's table for
035:

#+begin_src clojure :cache yes :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 35 36)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[f3260c3f510a9a32f1326e2a573192e146af518d]:
:results:
|-----+----------+----------+----------+--------+---------+--------|
| 035 | SAWMILL  | SMILE    | semolina | smell  | small   | simile |
|   Z | sea-mile | sea-mule | seamless | seemly | similar |        |
:end:


/Semolina/ belongs in the table for 035 by the "trailing-sounds
rule:"

#+begin_quote
/Ignore trailing sounds beyond the first three./
#+end_quote

Our "Ignore leading S and Z when there are four or more sounds"
rule is in conflict with our "Ignore trailing sounds beyond the
first three" rule. You can also see /seamless/ and /similar/ in
the table above for 035, but /similar/ also shows up in Furst's
table for 354:

#+begin_src clojure :cache yes :exports results :results verbatim drawer output
  (babomorph 454 455)
#+end_src

|     | mailer | milord | millwright | ameliorate | similar  |          |
:end:


*** TODO Fix These Exceptions

One way to fix this problem is to remove /seamless/ and /similar/
from 035 and leave them in 350 and 354, following the "ignore
leading S and Z when there are four or more sounds" rule.
Generalizing, insist that all 3-digit numbers of the form $0xy$,
with an actual leading 0 and two hard consonant sounds, $a$ and
$b$, have pegs and sound alikes with exactly three sounds
including the leading S or Z. Any four-or-more-sound words with
leading S or Z sound must encode numbers that /don't/ begin with
zero.

It's a major job to fix the tables following this scheme of
rules, and it will affect the methods for radices 16, 36, and 64.

# *** Extra Trailing Consonant Sounds

# /Millenium/ encodes 352 despite the trailing /...ium/. Likewise,
# trailing /...ing/ does not (usually) contribute to the encoding.

# *** Vowels and Weak Consonants

# Vowels and the weak sounds  H, W, WH, Y and so on, do
# not count. Thus, /Himalayans/ is 352 because the first strong
# consonant is M for 3 and the weak Y in the middle does not count.

** TODO /Composite Pegs/: New 3-Digit System

(John's idea)

It can be challenging to come up with more than 1,000 3-digit pegs
out of the blue. Perhaps we could get to 1,000 more easily by
combining 110 prefix pegs with 10 fixed, suffixes. For example:

# In the old system, the sounds $abc$ for numerals $xyz$ can be
# $hahbhch\ldots$, where $h$ stands for any weak consonant sound or,
# in the leading position, S or Z sound, and $\ldots$ stands for
# anything at all. In the more permissive, new system (under
# development), 3-digit codes are $hahbh\ldots{}hch\ldots{}$. For
# example:

*** Re-Deriving a Forgotten Peg

In case you find yourself forgetting a peg, there is an easy way
to re-derive it: go down the vowel sounds, short and long, in
order --- a, e, i, o, u --- and try sandwiching each vowel between the
bracketing consonants --- /nan/, /nane/, /nen/, /nene/, /nin/,
/nine/, /non/, /known/, /nun/. Eventually, you'll hit the
right one. For the ambiguous consonant clusters like 6 = J, SH,
CH, you may have to try a few combinations of consonants as well.

* Credit-Card Numbers

Consider the following, fake VISA number from

https://www.getcreditcardnumbers.com

\vskip 0.26cm
#+begin_example
  4716 5752 8659 3845
#+end_example

From the peg list, we get

| 4716 | RACK TISSUE |
| 5752 | LAKE LANE   |
| 8659 | FISH LAP    |
| 3845 | MUFF RAIL   |

There isn't an obvious narrative, here, but we get better
by starting with "fish" (picturesque and smelly) and working
sound-alikes backwards:

| 4716 | RACK dash | Take a fishing rod off the RACK and DASH   |
| 5752 | LAKE LANE | down to the LAKE via our favorite LANE.    |
| 8659 | FISH leap | The FISH are LEAPing today, so we          |
| 3845 | move reel | MOVE the REEL slowly (on the fishing rod). |

I can recall this credit-card number weeks after devising the
story, without much refreshing in between. Devising it took less
than a minute. I memorized it while devising it without extra
effort because I know the 2-digit peg table by heart.

* Hexadecimal: GUID & SHA-1
<<hexadecimal>>

There are several ways we might approach memorizing numbers that
include alphabetical glyphs or letters, such as numbers in base
16, 36, and 64. One way would be to mentally picture things that
go along with the letters, such as an A-frame house like a ski
chalet for A, and a honey bee for B, and so on. Feel free to
proceed this way should you like it. I recommend, however, that we
use the existing 2\nobreakdash-digit codes for the ASCII values of
the letters. For example, capital A has ASCII code 65, with peg
JAIL, and little A has ASCII code 97, with peg as BACK. We get two
phantasmagorias: a jail cell and a back, say the back of a prison
guard. We'll need the capital-uncial distinction for
radix-64 but not for hex or radix-36.

There is a price to pay for this choice: we can no longer encode
65 as JAIL or 97 as BACK, depending on the radix we're working
in. We'll have to do something else for them. The examples will
illustrate the technique.

For mapping /hexits/ (hexadecimal digits), extend the table with
the ASCII codes for A-F.

Remember that 7 can be /ng/ in Furst's system, the one we're
following, explaining why we get so many \ldots /ing/ words
for 67.

As noted, we lose the six pegs for 65 through 70. You can't
memorize a 65 in the text by picturing JAIL because JAIL means
A in hex. We need some other encoding or grouping of the digits.
For example, seeing a =265A=, we might think NICHE(26), LAW(5),
JAIL(A), or ANGEL(265), JAIL(A).

** Example GUID:

Hex is only a little harder than decimal.
Consider this random GUID generated by Java:

#+begin_example
5D00E7AA-C15C-44A5-93FA-A4DE6750B28A
#+end_example

Often, in real-world application, you don't need to memorize the
whole thing, but we'll do that for practice. Start with the pegs:

| =5D00 E7AA= | LAW CHEF SAUCE CHIP KEY JAIL JAIL |
| =C15C=      | CHALK TAIL CHALK                  |
| =44A5=      | REAR JAIL LAW                     |
| =93FA=      | BEAM CASE JAIL                    |
| =A4DE 675=  | JAIL RAY CHEF CHIP CHUCKLE        |
| =0B28 A=    | SAW JUDGE NAVY JAIL               |

*Note*:

- Encode 6750 as CHUCKLE SAW, not 67 50 CHALK LACE.
  CHALK decodes as C, not 67.

In the credit-card example, we worked backwards from the
picturesque peg FISH 86. Here we work backwards from the
seductive sound-alike NAIVE 28. The seductive emotion will make
it easier to memorize. Hallucinate a HELL-CHEF SAUCE, a recipe
for a naive victim.

| =5D00 E7AA= | HELL-chef SAUCE: CHOP, HACK, and CHILL the JELLY. |
| =C15C=      | SHAKE with TALLOW, CHECK                          |
| =44A5=      | the RARE CHILI OIL.                               |
| =93FA=      | "BE-MY HAGGIS, JILL!"                             |
| =A4DE 675=  | CHILL for an HOUR, SHAVE, CHOP, CHUCKLE.          |
| =0B28 A=    | "ASSAY, JUDGE!" NAIVE JILL.                       |

** Example SHA-1 Hash

From https://onlinehashtools.com, consider the following, 160-bit
hash: For git, it usually suffices to remember the first 8
hexits. Let's do them all as a workout:

| =A638 1B63= | JAIL SHAM-FRUIT TEA JUDGE CHIME |
| =D532 69BA= | CHEF LEMON JAW PEA JUDGE JAIL   |
| =418E 5FB1= | ARTFUL CHIP LAW CASE JUDGE TEA  |
| =BD50 3950= | JUDGE CHEF WHOLESOME PILLOWS    |
| =860D D679= | FISHES CHEF CHEF CHECKUP        |

*Notes*

- CHIME for 63 is ok in hex and R36, but not ok in R64, where it
  decodes as "/".

- Don't encode 69 as CHIP, rather as JAW PEA, because CHIP
  decodes as E.

- An alternative to WHOLESOME PILLOWS for 50 3950 is LACE MAP
  LACE, but it's clumsy.

Let's bribe a judge and put him to sleep with hashish (puns help the
memory), then summon middle-Eastern heavenly dreams.

| =A638 1B63= | with SHAWL and SHAM-FRUIT, TEA for the JUDGE, JIM. |
| =D532 69BA= | SHAVE a LEMON WEDGE, PAY the JUDGE to CHILL.       |
| =418E 5FB1= | an ARTFUL SHAPE of this LAW CASE, SHUSH THEE!      |
| =BD50 3950= | HASHISH ACHIEVES ELYSIUM BLESSINGS                 |
| =860D D679= | FETCHES the CHIEF, JEHOVAH for JACOB!              |

* Radix 36
<<r36>> Radix-36 is more difficult to find "in the wild" than is
either hex or Radix-64. I most often see it in randomly generated
file and directory names because some file systems are not
case-sensitive and neither is R36. R36 is also sometimes found in
URLs for encoding queries or other data. Despite the fact that
URLs, except for the domain name, are case-sensitive, some sites,
especially older ones, and even some browsers and
query-generators, don't adhere to the standard properly. Radix-64
is overkill in such circumstances and uses up alternatives, but
radix-36 is immune to the commonplace nonconformance of the
internet.

For encoding /rixits/ in R36 (or biscuits in base-36?), I use
ASCII pegs for the capital letters beyond hex. Find their
sound-alikes in Section [[all-pegs]]. Because R36 is case-insensitive,
we need only one set of pegs. For Radix-64, we need both upper and
lower case, so two pegs per letter.

The stars in the table below mark pegs for the lower case. They
help for remembering the ASCII pair --- upper and lower case ---
but they're only pertinent for R64 (Section [[r64]]). The numbers in
parentheses refer to the ordinal number of the letter in the
alphabet: K is the eleventh letter in the alphabet, and 11 has peg
/tot/, whom I visualize as Alice of Wonderland. Further
associations with Hebrew keywords like /mayim/ (water) and
/nakhash/ (snake) or with playing cards like the club
jack are given, as explained in section [[daily-practice]].

Spack (https://spack.io/) is a dependency solver for software

*Notes*

- CAR for 74 is not ok because it decodes as J. Peg it as KEY
  RAY, then try sound-alikes.

- FISH is V in R36, not 86. If we had 86, peg it as FEE JAW,
  then try sound-alikes.

- 72 can't be CAN, because that's H in R36. Peg it as KEY
  NOAH then try sound-alikes.

* Passwords

Don't make passwords easy for bots to guess. Random, long passwords
are best, but hard to remember, even with our systems. They're
even more difficult to associate uniquely with a web site.

Modern web sites don't store your passwords in the clear.
Virtually all, nowadays, hash your password with a one-way hash
(and usually some salt and a nonce challenge). That means you
expose nothing by re-using part of a password, so long as it's
different from site-to-site.

Pick a difficult prefix, but memorable to you. Mix in a special
character and a numeral because many sites insist on such. Start
with something picturesque:

/An Octopus has eight legs with suckers/.

Now, partially encode and obfuscate it; this is your personal salt
prefix:

=2Octopu$Ha$8Leg$With0740=

Finally, append the site name, perhaps obfuscated:

=2Octopu$Ha$8Leg$With0740EBAY=

=2Octopu$Ha$8Leg$With0740APPLE=

=2Octopu$Ha$8Leg$With0740OVERLEAF=

Anyone who knows your personal salt prefix and your algorithm will
break you. But bots will just see a random hash, completely
different for each site you visit. Remember that hashes are
uniformly distributed. The hash of any input is
equally likely to be anywhere in the space of hashes. There is no
way to tell how similar two input texts $A$ and $A'$ are from
their hashes, even if $A$ and $A'$ differ by no more than one bit.
Bots will have no way to know that you are even using an algorithm
to construct your passwords.

* Daily Practice: ASCII, Cards, NATO, Hebrew, Dates
<<daily-practice>>

Table 1 exploits the coincidence that there are 52 glyphs in the
ASCII Latin alphabet, 52 cards in a standard pack, and 52 weeks of
the year. There are only 22 Hebrew letters, so the last four rows
of each 26 are empty in the Hebrew column.

Table 1 is in groups of 13 corresponding to the suits of playing
cards. Each group also contains dates in a quarterly
month-week pattern of 5-4-4: 5 weeks in Jan, 4 in Feb, 4 in Mar,
etc. The first days of the months are in the easy pattern 155,
274, 263, 153. You may memorize this as a honeymoon tale of
TAILLIGHTS, NIAGRA, UNASHAMED, HOTELMAN. Table 2 focuses on some
phantasmagorias specifically for dates.

These are for non-leap years only, so not great for computing
day-of-the-week. I have another method for that (the method of
Furst, debugged) in Section [[day-of-week]].

My daily practice includes another $156=3\times{}52=2\times{}78$
three columns of phantasmagorias for the 156 faces of a standard
Tarot pack, obverse and reverse. See Section [[tarot]]. These are a
source of vivid mental imagery.

I go down table 1 in my mind when I need to fall asleep. I usually
get four or five rows before drifting off, so next time through, I
start up where I left off. Sometimes, I recite it backwards just
to make sure the end of the table doesn't get soft from lack of
repetition. Here are the "mental movies," expanded from the hints
in Sections [[hexadecimal]], [[r36]], and [[r64]]. I include sense
of smell because it works for me. It might not work for
you.

1. ALPHA --- The ALPHA LION (ARYEH) is in the giant, Disneyland
   TEACUP. He and the teacup are in JAIL and the jailer has her
   BACK turned to us. A female jailer, being unusual, is easier to
   remember. Smell the dank musty odor of the jail.

2. BAKER --- is serving a BEEF meal to a JUDGE, who is in full
   magistrate's dress including a powdered wig. The meal is taking
   place in the little BOOTH (BAYIT) on top of NOAH's Ark. Smell
   the food.

3. CHARLIE --- is riding a CAMEL (GAMAL), looking at himself in
   the ME (3, mirror) having a hell of a time tying his bow tie
   while bouncing around on the back of the camel and smoking a
   PIPE. The camel is dragging ropes with colored sidewalk CHALK
   behind him making marks on the ground. Smell the pipe tobacco
   smoke mixed with stinky camel fur and road dust.

4. DELTA --- I am pointing a flashlight (RAY) at a giant,
   brass-and-wooden DOOR (DALET), looking for a keyhole in the
   rain and the dark (smell mold and mildew and moss and grass and
   old machine-oil grease on the door's hardware). I open it up
   and there is a PhD student who never finished his THESIS so
   must work as a CHEF. I see, hear, and smell the food he is
   cooking. Alternatively, a laser pointer is etching the blue
   lines around the margins of the THESIS paper (such thesis paper
   with blue lines was common in my day).

5. ECHO --- Moses is delivering the LAW on mount Sinai. A cop at
   the bottom of the hill (HAR) is holding up his hand: "stop!" In
   between his fingers there are poker CHIPS and pieces of
   Cinnamon TOAST (smell it). ECHO begins with E, which is Greek
   Eta and looks like the letter H of /hill/ and /HAR/. (/Hill/
   and /har/ are obvious English-Hebrew cognates by a shift of the
   liquid consonants /l/ and /r/.) Smell the desert sands.

6. FOXTROT --- Lurch is clenching a pink (VERED) rose in his teeth
   and lantern JAW. He has an open CASE on his lap filled with a
   DOZEN more pink roses. Smell the roses.

7. GOLF --- I have a golden (ZAHAV) KEY to my golf cart, where my
   black CAT is waiting with my golf TWOSOME. Smell the fuel of
   the golf cart mixed with the grass smell of the golf course.

8. HOTEL --- I am in the lobby of the beautiful Bellagio hotel
   with my smelly donkey (CHAMOR) and a #10 coffee CAN full of
   stinky cigar butts. I have a forked DOWSER rod in my hands. I
   am waiting in line to pay the exorbitant FEE. The dowser is
   vibrating as it detects the nearness of water, or gold, because
   I am going to pay my fee in gold.

9. INDIA --- I am in a junkyard full of old Rolls-Royce DIESEL
   (smell it) automobiles with their camshafts poking out of their
   hoods (remember via the trivium that there are more
   Rolls-Royces in India than in Britain). In the cockpit of one
   Rolls-Royce is a pilot (TAYYAS) up to his neck in PEA soup.

10. JULIET --- with her painted TOES (10) and fingernails, is
    leading a WOOD-SAGE (dwarf druid) by the hand (YAD) to his
    brightly colored racing CAR parked in a clearing in the woods.
    Smell the forest.

11. KILO --- Alice of Wonderland (a TOT) comes off her throne
    (KISEH) to deliver a kilo of COAL to a troll with huge TUSKS.
    Smell the coal and the body odor of the filthy troll king.

12. LIMA --- A girl is sunning herself and holding a silver
    platter under her chin to ensure it gets TANNED. On the tray
    is a loaf of bread (LECHEM) with flies buzzing around it
    (smell it because it's extra hot, baking in the sunshine). She
    takes a strip of ADHESIVE flypaper and dangles it into a CAGE
    to trap the flies.

13. MIKE --- A pod of orca whales are flipping a Tam-j'Shanter
    (beanie hat with a red pom-pom) in the water (MAYIM). I take a
    TEASPOON of water and drizzle it on a gigantic chocolate CAKE,
    the size of a five-gallon cylindrical paint barrel. Smell the
    seawater.

14. NOVEMBER --- A snake (NACHASH) is sizzling on a patch of hot
    TAR asphalt (smell it). It has neither arms nor legs, so, of
    course, it is wearing a shirt with CUFFS, plus TIGHTS instead
    of trousers (absolute absurdity helps the memory).

15. OSCAR --- A TEETOTALER wearing a Carrie-Nation CAP is holding
    an Oscar cinema award. A tiger with a striped TAIL is clenching a
    book (SEFER) in its jaws and bringing it to the teetotaler.
    Smell the tiger: a "zoo" smell.

16. PAPA --- is wiping tears from his eyes (AYIN) with a TISSUE.
    He is overcomes with emotion looking at the beautiful face of
    Liz Taylor as Cleopatra, whose picture is held by a giant
    TITAN robot. Smell Liz's perfume.

17. QUEBEC --- A very FAT premier of Quebec is lying face-down on
    a bed of TACKS and turning his face (PANIM) to a TOTEM to
    pray. Smell the wood and paint of the totem.

18. ROMEO --- has a sparrow (TZIPPOR) with her feet stuck in a
    patch of sticky TAFFY (smell it) on his shoulder. He brings
    her to a TATAR princess, who is being FANNED by several slave
    girls (or boys!).

19. SIERRA --- I finally get some FAME from publishing my first
    book, TITLED "Sierra." I celebrate with a beer pulled from a
    TAP by a monkey (QUF). Smell the beer.

20. TANGO --- A DEATHWATCH soldier with four arms and three swords
    is carrying Goliath's head (ROSH), which has a giant NOSE.
    Smell the blood. He tangos awkwardly toward a bus, where he
    mounts the steps in a palsy and pays his FARE inside.

21. UNIFORM --- A skeleton (SHELED) holding a butterfly net FALLS
    into a bigger NET along with a man-sized HOT-DOG. Smell it.

22. VICTOR --- A NUN with a Christian FISH pendant presides over a
    victory, a burning at the stake (AUTO-DA-FE). She is holding a
    pet crocodile (TANIN) by a leash. Smell everything.

23. WHISKEY --- A TEDDY-BEAR rests on a bed with a book of Edna
    St. Vincent Millay's poems: "A few FIGS from Thistles." A
    small NAMEPLATE rests against a tumbler of WHISKEY on the
    nightstand (smell the whiskey).

24. X-RAY --- NERO is playing his FIFE (not a fiddle) while
    watching Rome burn. He uses his X-RAY vision to look through
    the clothes of a bunch of DANCING people in the yard.

25. YANKEE --- An American flag is NAILED to the wall. Two nails
    stick out. A DOUGHNUT with icing and sprinkles (smell it)
    dangles from one nail and a watch-FOB is looped over the other
    nail.

26. ZULU --- An ATHENIAN comes up to BASE (baseball). Next to him
    is a NICHE with a bust of Athena dressed in Zulu regalia in it.

It is a small matter to add the date phantasmagorias to the
mental movies we already have for the 52 glyphs. It takes only a
little more effort to add the "Day-of-Year Phantasmagorias."

* Tarot
<<tarot>>

Tarot cards have vivid imagery and powerful, emotional,
words, great for memory.

There are 78 Tarot cards in a standard Rider-Waite pack. That's
not divisible by 52, but if we consider the reverse images
(upside-down cards) as distinct to the obverse, and most
cartomancers do, then we have 156 image-word combinations, and
that is divisible by 52. Thus, we get an additional three columns
of picture words for daily practice ([[daily-practice]]), where we
associate them with standard playing cards, the NATO alphabet, the
ASCII codes, weeks of the year, day of the year, and Hebrew words.

The Tarot suits are wands, clubs, swords, and pentacles, obviously
related to the suits of a standard pack, but different enough that
we'll just keep those two sets of suits distinct in our minds.
There are 14 cards in each suit, but only 22 trumps, aka majors.
Let's take the Knights out of each suit and append them to the
majors so that the minor suits have 13 cards each, including three
court cards --- page (like "jack"), queen, and king.

* People's names

Take the name, convert to a number using the usual rules. Memorize the number
as usual using the memorization technique. When recalling, you can use
pinfruit.com or other means, enter the number and it will print all
possibilities. There will be more than one, but usually you will remember at
this point which one is the correct one. And if not, all the other ones are
soundalike, so you will not make a big mistake, which is much better than not
knowing the name at all.

Examples.

Jordan -> 6412 -> Jordan, Sheridan (memorize, e.g., as /sure tone/)

Brian -> 942 -> Brian, Brain, Bryan, Brown (memorize, e.g., as /hebrew now/)

Ondrej -> 214 -> Andrew, Andrea, Andrei (memorize, e.g., as /winter/)

Pick words and create a movie related to something that you know about the
person (for example they like WINTER sports like hockey, or they are learning
HEBREW NOW, or they use SURE TONE when coaching).

* APPENDICES
** Pegs and Phantasmagorias

I blogged out the basics of my peg method here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2010/11/21/memory-pegs/

** Sound-Alikes

Finding a sound-alike is "computing" or "calculating" a picture
word. For example, the peg for 37 is MIKE. Picture a microphone
in your hand and feel the electrical tingling. Adding synaesthesia
or emotion to pegs helps my memory. It may not help other people.
Do what is best for you!

To calculate some nearby picture words, I get

- mica :: Glittering stone; feel grit on your fingers.

- mug :: A big cold beer.

- muck :: Smell the barnyard.

- Mecca :: Picture the kaaba and the pilgrims circulating.

- hammock :: Take a snooze.

** Building and Revising Chains

Take time building phantasmagorias so that ideas flow. It's bad to
have a break part-way-through, causing a pause or failure in
recall. You must be /fast/ and /accurate/. A break or even a soft
link in a chain is cause for starting over and building a new
chain.

** One Peg Set, Forever

Choose pegs that work for you, then */NEVER CHANGE THEM/*. Recall
must be instantaneous. Whenever you see or think of a number, you
must recall the peg without effort.

I regret changing a few pegs once. I did it for teaching purposes
because my originals got dated. For example, 3 for /May/ became
/me/ because no one today knows what a May-pole is. Every time I
see 3, however, I picture a May-pole instead of myself in a
mirror. I learned May-pole first (from Furst and from my Dad). The
switch slows me down even though I made the switch long, long ago.

*DON'T CHANGE PEGS AFTER LOCKING THEM IN*

** Alternatives for Hex

*** Hex Method 1
<<hex-method-1>>

One way to encode hex is to map A-F to 010-015. Permanent pegs are

Here is the GUID, again.

5D00E7AA-C15C-44A5-93FA-A4DE6750B28A
#+end_example

How about a pseudo-poem about wildlife:

| =5D00E=  | OWL of WISDOM and SASSY STARING eyes.        |
| =7AA=    | HAWK, look SIDEWAYS left and SIDEWAYS right. |
| =C15C44= | STAND TALL, SUDDEN HARRIER                   |
| =A5=     | and ASSIDUOUS OWL!                           |
| =93FA=   | PUMA, STEALthy CITIZEN,                      |
| =DE6750= | STAMP! STRIKE! SHAKE, LASSIE!                |
| =B28A=   | Don't HESITATE. ENOUGH, CITIZEN!             |

*** Hex Method 2
<<hex-method-2>>

Another technique for hex is to exclusively use the single-word
pegs TOES-TISSUE $[10..15]$ for the hexits $[A..F]$. For decimal
digits that spell in 10-15, use two 1-digit pegs. For example,
don't spell 15 as TAIL; that's for F exclusively. Spell it as TOE
EEL or some such.

Here we go, pegs, first:

| =5D00E7AA=     | LAW TAM SAUCE TAR KEY TOES TOES           |
| =C15C=         | TAN TEA TAIL TAN                          |
| =44A5=         | REAR TOES LAW                             |
| =93FA=         | BEAM TAIL TOES                            |
| =A4DE6750B28A= | TOES RAY TAM TAR CHALK LACE TOT REEF TOES |

Ignore 'ing' in the following, wherein we are assaulted by a
Scottish traffic cop:

| =5D00E7AA=     | A Scottish policeman (LAW) wearing a TAM o'Shanter gives |
|                | me SASS. Pulls me over on the TARmac and demands my KEY. |
|                | I TOSS it on his TOES.                                   |
|                |                                                          |
| =C15C=         | "DONE IT WELL, laddie!"                                  |
|                |                                                          |
| =44A5 93FA A4= | THEN ROARING, "'TIS LOW, you BUM!                        |
|                | 'TILL he EATS TAZER!'"                                   |
|                |                                                          |
| =DE6750B28A=   | "DAMN TAR! SHAKE LESS! TIGHT ENOUGH on my TOES!"         |

Method 1 produces more compact phantasmagorias and extends to higher
radices.

*** SHA-1 by Hex Method 1

#+begin_example
a638 1b63 d532 69ba 418e
5fb1 bd50 3950 860d d679
#+end_example

Using Method 1, ignore common grammatical suffixes like "-ing" and
"-ful;" prepositions like "to" and "of;" pronouns and relative
adjective,words like "this," and "that;" forms of the verb "to
be," and other obvious connector words like "the" and "a."

Let's take a look at a statue in the artist's studio:

| =A638= | SIDEWAYS CHAMFER?                   |
| =1B6E= | the TOE of this STATUE is a SHAM    |
| =D532= | SODIUM is not ALUMINUM!             |
| =69BA= | its SHAPE in the STUDIO is SIDEWAYS |
| =418E= | ARTFUL HISTORY                      |
|        |                                     |
| =5FB1= | LAY a STOOL by the STATUE'S TOE     |
| =BD50= | STATUE is STAMPED "ALICE"           |

** Alternatives for Radix-64
<<public-keys>>

*** Methods 1 and 2, Again

A method-1 ([[hex-method-1]]) encoding of rixits, reserving 010
through 064, follows:

#+begin_example
0       8 010   016     024     032     040     048     056    063
v       v v     v       v       v       v       v       v      v
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+/
#+end_example

**** Advantages of this encoding:

- There are so many picturesque words in English that begin with S
  that we have a deep well to draw from.

- The code for a letter is its numerical value in R64: $A=10, O=24$, etc.

  - Disadvantage of this advantage: we're working on memory, not
    on evaluation, so maybe this feature isn't so interesting.

**** Problems with this encoding:

***** Off-By-One Mental Arithmetic

Notice that 024 is O, but you may remember that O is also the
15-th capital glyph of the alphabet. Adding 10 for the first ten
digits of the encoding, $15+A = 15+10 = 25$, not 24. This is an
opportunity for error at speed. But we can deal with it.

To encode O, remembered as the 15-th letter of the alphabet,
first subtract 1 to correct the off-by-one error, getting 14.
Then add 10 to account for the leading ten digits $0..9$ of the
encoding, getting 24. Prepend the leading $s=0$ for the radix to
get $024$, say /sunrise/.

Encode: subtract 1, add 10, i.e., add 9.

Here's a slogan:

*/Encode: enhance nine./*

$O\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}024\rightarrow{}\textrm{sunrise}$.

To decode $\textrm{sunrise}=024$, remove the leading $s=0$ to
get 24. Subtract 10 to get 14. Add 1 to get 15, the 15-th
capital letter.

Decode: add 1, subtract 10, i.e., subtract 9.

*/Decode: deduct nine./*

$\textrm{sunrise}\rightarrow{}024\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}O$.

For small letters, add and subtract 26.

$o\rightarrow{}15\rightarrow{}41\rightarrow{}50\rightarrow{}050\rightarrow{}\textrm{solstice}$.

$\textrm{solstice}\rightarrow{}050\rightarrow{}50\rightarrow{}24\rightarrow{}15$ in lower case.

It's a lot of mental arithmetic, but that's fun, too. Balance
the fun factor against the need for recall speed and accuracy.
\newpage
***** ASCII Popups

If you've memorized ASCII, you already have pegs for A-Z and a-z.
They will pop up at speed. You can either force them away; use
them as with Method 2 above, accepting the trade-off risk of
collisions and ambiguity, or go with ASCII in my first method.

*** Structure in Public Keys
<<key-structure>>

Generating another public key on my machine, notice that the
first 6 quads, 24 Rixits, 64 bits each, 1536 bits, are the same in

That's it for cross-checking; on to memorization.

Let's tell a tale of poisoning an indiscreet lover.

*** Old Old Method
<<old-old-method>>

I blogged out a more trivial method, similar to method 2 for GUIDs
some time ago:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/memorizing-in-base-64/

This method maps the rixits directly to the pegs. The mental
arithmetic is the same as above: computing a peg number from
characters A..Z and a..z by adding 9 and-or-26. We just lose the
leading S, so we lose some richness to the vocabulary.

*** Radix-64 Method 3
<<method-3>>
Another method, which I have not tried, is to map the alphabetic
letters to their S-enhanced letter numbers, as in

| A   |  01 |
| B   |  02 |
| ... | ... |
| Z   | 026 |
| a   | 027 |
| b   | 028 |
| ... | ... |
| z   | 052 |

The decimal digits go to their regular pegs, 0..9. This is a
variation of the old-old-method ([[old-old-method]]).

** Memorizing Dates

For most kids, history class is torture because of the need to
memorize dates. But that's a snap with the peg system. I still
remember from 11-th grade that

RAY TAN CHAT

was the beginning day of the Civil War, because you tanned me with
a RAY gun and that ended the peace talks. April 12, 1861.

** Memorizing a Shuffled Card Pack
<<card-pack>>
I blogged this out in December, 2010, starting here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/take-the-diamonds/

Here is a scrape of the relevant blog posts. Note that the
encoding of the cards is totally unrelated to that in the
[daily-practice] section (Section [[daily-practive]]. Don't get them confused, and pick only
one if you find it difficult to store two encodings.

*** Take the Diamonds

Do you smell machine oil the instant you see the Diamond Queen from a
pack of cards? How about cigarette smoke when you see the Diamond Six,
or baby powder when you see the Diamond Ace? Read on . . .

Take the entire suit of Diamonds out of a pack of cards and lay them out
in order, from Ace to King, in front of you on a table. Notice that the
word “diamond” begins with a D, and recall that the consonant sound D
stands for the number 1 -- or for the digit “1” in combination with
other digits, as we have been using it so far. Think of the suit,
diamonds, as the tens digit in combination with the plain digit of each
card. Then the diamond Ace will be 11 -- 1 for the tens digit from
“diamonds” and 1 for the Ace itself, since it's the first card in the
suit. The Ace through the Nine come out with no problem at all and they
hook up immediately with our memorized, permanent pegs. As you go
through the list below, really take some time to stare at the card and
visualize the mental picture right on the face of the card. If the deck
is one you can write on or draw on, draw a little cartoon or write the
picture word on the face of the card. You'll be using these cards to
help you lock in the pegs:

| /Card/ | /Num/ | /Peg/  | /Mental Picture/                                        |
|--------+-------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------|
| D A    |    11 | tot    | Alice from Alice in Wonderland.                         |
|        |       |        | Smell baby-powder in the air.                           |
| D 2    |    12 | tan    | Someone tanning herself holding a reflective            |
|        |       |        | tray under her chin. Smell tanning oil.                 |
| D 3    |    13 | tam    | A tam-o-shanter tartan cap with red pom-pom on the head |
|        |       |        | of a Scottish warrior in full kilts. Smell heather.     |
| D 4    |    14 | tar    | A sizzling hot stretch of deserted highway,             |
|        |       |        | so hot the tar is sticky. Smell the tar, too.           |
| D 5    |    15 | tail   | The orange-and-black striped tail of an enormous tiger. |
|        |       |        | Imagine a zoo smell.                                    |
| D 6    |    16 | tissue | Someone wiping tears from her eyes after remembering    |
|        |       |        | an emotional event. Smell cigarette smoke and think     |
|        |       |        | of the song “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.”                  |
| D 7    |    17 | tack   | A huge thumbtack or map-pin holding something on a      |
|        |       |        | big cork board. Smell fresh ink and paper.              |
| D 8    |    18 | taffy  | A big blob of hot, sweet-smelling pink and green taffy  |
|        |       |        | candy, stuck to your fingers getting all over the card. |
| D 9    |    19 | tap    | A beer tap spilling beer all over the card, splashing   |
|        |       |        | on your clothes and making a smelly mess.               |

Notice I've added smell to the associations, and even a song. We can
really take this idea far and involve taste and touch over all the pegs,
and we may do that in the future --- it will be an interesting exercise.
This is one of the things that Eran Katz suggests to do in his books
(highly recommended), and since smell works very well for my personal
memory, I'm adding it to my permanent inventory and inviting you along
for this addition.

We have only four cards to go. The diamond 10 is pretty easy -- I'm just
going to pick the peg “toes” and picture the woman painting her toenails
all different colors. And the smell? Toenail Polish! Easy.

And for the last three, let's promote the 1 to the hundreds digit and
sneak in some three-digit pegs (from the third layer -- a preview).
Notice we may have some extra consonant sounds on the ends of the
three-digit pegs. They're throw-aways, because the system doesn't go to
four or more digits at a time. 1,110 permanent pegs is quite enough!

| /Card/ | /Num/ | /Peg/      | /Mental Picture/                                 |
|--------+-------+------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| D J    |   111 | teetotaler | Picture a prissy little man with ill-fitting     |
|        |       |            | clothes, a crooked bow tie, thick eyeglasses     |
|        |       |            | and a pocket protector pontificating on the      |
|        |       |            | virtues of total abstinence from alcohol.        |
|        |       |            | Smell Lysol (too much cleaning)                  |
| D Q    |   112 | titan      | Picture an enormous robot with rivets all over   |
|        |       |            | its shell. Smell machine oil and steel.          |
| D K    |   113 | totem      | Picture a Native-American totem pole with        |
|        |       |            | effigies of bears, salmon, and a huge, winged    |
|        |       |            | eagle on top.                                    |
|        |       |            | Smell a campfire and the wood of the totem pole. |

That's it. Take your suit of diamonds along with you, pull it out and
practice the visualization and imaginary smelling exercise whenever you
find yourself having to kill time. Just a few times over this and you
won't need the cards any more. You will INSTANTLY smell and see taffy
when you think of the Diamond-8. The Diamond Queen will INSTANTLY bring
to mind the smell of machine oil and steel. And vice versa, and through
the entire suit.

*** Shuffle the Diamonds

... and go through the 13 cards, in order, forming a linked
sequence of vivid mental pictures. Here's what I came up with
yesterday

Alice in Wonderland (tot = 11 = DAce) is wiping a tears from her eyes
with a

tissue (16 = D6). She is standing by a sizzling hot highway and her feet
are sinking into the

tar (14 = D4). Across the highway, a six-foot tall beer

tap (19 = D9) is gushing beer onto the tarmac. The beer boils on
contact, releasing a strong beer smell, and runs gently downhill into a
grid of huge, multicolored

tacks (17 = D7) pushed into the tarmac. These tacks are also piercing
and holding down a tiger's

tail (15 = D5), and the tiger is roaring in pain and licking a huge lump
of pink-and-green alcoholic

taffy (18 = D8) by the other side of the road from Alice to soothe his
pain. In front of the tiger, a

teetotaler (111 = DJ), specially summoned from AA for the situation, is
wagging his finger at the tiger and delivering a stern warning about the
evils of alcoholic taffy. The other hand of the teetotaler is exposed to
the hot sun and is getting quite a

tan (12 = D2). With that overtanning hand, he is holding the right hand
of a steel robot

titan (112 = Q2) who is wagging his head, clicking and beeping, emitting
the odor of machine oil, and, with his other hand, painting his

toenails (toes = 10 = D10) and also the toenails of the

totem (113 = DK) standing right next to him (smell the toenail polish).
The top of the totem is obscured by a huge

tam-o-shanter (13 = D3), which is baking in the hot sun and emitting a
strong smell of roasting wool

Now, I came up with this phantasmagoria yesterday morning in less than
one minute, I did not think about it all day, the day was very, very
busy with other activities, I went out for a couple of drinks after
work, slept through the night, and didn't think of this for a whole 24
hours until just now. I remembered it almost perfectly (I forgot the
tacks, and all that means is that I didn't form the mental picture
vividly enough -- I had the tiger's tail threaded around the tacks, but
I recommended to you to imagine the pins pushed THROUGH the tail, adding
the roaring and pain to the phantasmagoria). If I had been more careful,
I would have remembered it perfectly.

Think about this: by exploiting the visual imagination and dragging in
all the other senses -- feeling the heat, smelling the smells, hearing
the sounds, I was able to remember 24 hours later, after a minute of
looking, a shuffled suit of cards (and, if I had been more careful, I
would have remembered it perfectly!). When I am in practice, I can
memorize an entire shuffled deck in 2 minutes, while you deal them out
(I'll teach you the other suits later, while we go through the second
layer of the memory system). When I am out of practice, 4 minutes is
plenty. Even better, I can memorize 39 of the cards and then tell you
the remaining 13 cards just by running down the suits in my mind and
naming the cards that aren't in my phantasmagoria. I can even do it
tomorrow from yesterday's shuffle.

This is a great party trick. The pros can do this really fast. The
athletes in the world memory championships
([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Memory_Championships]]) can do it
in less than 30 seconds, and they can memorize the order of 8 shuffled
decks in 15 minutes.

Try this. You will amaze yourself. Then, think of practical
applications.

*** The 40s and Hearts

Back with the 10's we learned pegs to memorize a shuffling of the
diamond suit, in any order. This time, we'll learn pegs for the 40's and
for the hearts suit. The reason to associate hearts with the 40's is
that the first important consonant in ‘hearts' is ‘r,' a digit 4, which
we promote to the number 40 for the application of memorizing cards.
Here are my permanent pegs for the 40's. As always, feel free to tailor
this set to your own memory style

| Num | Sound | Peg  | Description                                     | Others |

|     |       |      |                                                 | radio  |

|  44 | RR    | rear | distinctive rear end of Corvette automobile;    | rare   |
|     |       |      | driving it with the top down                    | roar   |
|     |       |      |                                                 | horror |
|  45 | RL    | rail | brass rail at a wood-paneled bar; can't reach   | whorl  |
|     |       |      | it with your feet; beer and darts               | whirl  |
|     |       |      |                                                 | reel   |

|     |       |      |                                                 | rush   |
|  47 | RK    | rack | rack of antlers on caribou head mounted over    | wreck  |
|     |       |      | the fireplace                                   | rag    |
|     |       |      |                                                 | rug    |
|  48 | RF    | reef | coral reef; brightly colored tropical fish;     | roof   |
|     |       |      | SCUBA diving gear; rubber, seawater             | rave   |
|     |       |      |                                                 | wharf  |

Those pegs cover the playing cards Heart Ace (41) through Heart Ten
(40). We need three more for the face cards

Heart Jack: 411, rat-a-tat-tat; picture a machine gun; you're carrying
it and shooting it at things

Heart Queen: 412, rattan; picture white wicker furniture

Heart King: 413, radium; picture the item-to-remember pulsing with the
(imaginary) green glow of radioactive radium.

Pick the diamonds and the hearts out of a pack of cards, shuffle them,
and prepare to memorize the order. Take your time: don't rush it. Go for
accuracy. The speed will come naturally with practice. Here's an example
of a run I did just now, building this story in my mind in real time. If
you follow along and build the miniature movie in your mind, you will no
trouble recalling the order of the cards. Take special effort to chain
the pegs one to another (yes, this is a combined application of
chain-memory and peg-memory):

(D2) I'm outside in the hot sun getting a */tan/*, but I'm really
burning and it hurts

(H5) There's a tropical drink station on the beach and there is a very
prominent brass */rail/* where I want to rest my feet while I order a
cool drink, but I can't quite reach it with my feet

(HQ) I sit in a stool made of white */rattan/*; hear the distinctive
creaking sound as you sit and try to reach the rail with your feet

(H3) Sitting next to me is a guy holding on to the reins of his riding
*/ram/* and the ram is chewing the rattan (this is an important
connection as it's easy to forget the rattan without making the ram do
something with it)

(H10) he pulls out of his pocket a scale model of a NASCAR */race/*
track and places it on the counter, and the cars start going around

(DA) Alice from Wonderland (a */tot/*) walks up to take a look at the
model race track

(DK) she puts a pint-sized */totem/* pole right in the middle of the
oval racetrack

(HJ) one of the effigies in the totem has a machine gun in its hand and
starts shooting at the cars (rat-a-tat-tat)

(H4) many of the cars are Corvettes with their distinctive */rear/* ends
(four circular red lights, 2-by-2). The bullets are shooting out the red
lights

(DJ) a teetotaler comes up to us at the tropical bar and lectures on the
violent side-effects of drinking alcohol, using the machine-gunning
totem as evidence

(H7) he points to a */rack/* of antlers mounted on the wall of the
tropical bar as further evidence: the hunter must have been drinking to
go after such a huge caribou

(D9) we all laugh and him and order the bartender to pull us more beers
from the */tap/*

(H8) some divers out in the */reef/* hear the sound of the enormous beer
tap pouring beer and pop their heads out of the waves and shout at us to
pour some for them, too

(D3) we notice that some of the divers are wearing */tam/*-o-shanters
over their dive helmets

(D5) tigers (with orange-and-black striped */tails/*) run along the
beach into the waves and snatch the tam-o-shanters in their jaws.

(D6) they run a big circle over toward us, stop and wipe tears from
their eyes (with */tissues/*) out of regret for stealing the
tam-o-shanters

(H2) all of a sudden, it clouds over and a driving, tropical rain soaks
the weeping tigers with tams in their teeth and pounds on the roof of
the tropical drink station

(HK) the weather radio in the back of the bar starts to blare news at a
high volume about the storm and pulse very brightly with green
*/radium/* glow

(HA) huge black */rats/* scurry out from behind the bar, scared out by
the sudden noise of the radio -- see the radium glistening on their
greasy, rain-soaked fur

(D4) the rats run all the way out to the */tar/*mac in the parking lots
near the beach, and the hot tar is steaming from the sudden rain; the
rats are jumping on the hot tar

(D8) they run over to piles of hot green and white */taffy/* piled up in
one corner of the tarmac and start eating it voraciously

(D10) on top of the piles of taffy are young women painting their
*/toe/*nails -- yes, in the driving rain -- and dripping the toenail
polish on the taffy

(D7) the toenail polish is running down the taffy and flowing around the
shafts of enormous thumb*/tack/*s embedded in the base of the piles of
taffy

(H6) under each thumbtack is a doctor's prescription for */rash/*
medication; it's going to help with all the sunburns we got

(H9) tied to each prescription is a burlap */rope/* (don't know where
this is going, yet, but just tie them up

(DQ) at the other end of each rope is a */titan/*, a robot, pulling on
the rope

That's it -- now close your eyes and run through the movie in your mind,
and the cards will play out in order. Try not to go back and peek. If
you have to do that, it means that you didn't form a sufficiently strong
association linking one mental picture with the next. Practice will make
perfect!

didn't form the connected images strongLY enough first time around.

*** The 70s and Clubs

By now, you know the drill. The 70's are another decade in the regular
peg list of the second layer of the system. Just as the 10's stand for
the diamonds (because the ‘D' of ‘diamond' is a sound for 1, and 1 is
the first digit of each visual memory word for the diamond suit), and
the 40's stand for hearts (because the ‘R' of ‘heaRts' is a 4-sound),
the 70's stand for the club suit. You will get three bonus visual-words
from the third layer for the Jack, Queen, and King of clubs. Practice
with the club suit alone, locking in the visual words, then mix in the
hearts and diamonds. You will be able to memorize a shuffled pack of
these 39 cards and impress yourself. Without further ado, here is my

*** The 90s and Spades

This is the last set of ten, permanent peg words in the second layer of
the system, with three bonus words from the third layer so we can
memorize the last suit of a card deck, the spades. Every number in the
90's begins with the digit 9, and the consonant cluster for 9 is B and
P. The word “Spade” encodes to 091; ignore the leading zero and pick the
9=P to stand for the spades, so the spades will come from the 90's. In
later blogs, we'll summarize the entire second layer, add a couple of
odds and ends, and work on applications like card tricks.

** Calculating Day of the Week
<<day-of-week>>

I blogged this out here:

https://rebcabin.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/590/

Here is an edited scrape:

Remember Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie “Rainman,” who can
instantly say the day of the week for a given date? Of course, he was
an autistic savant and probably didn't know and certainly couldn't teach
how he does it, but here is a method I learned from my Dad [Furst
has the same method].

Preliminaries:

Do all math mod 7, that is, you only need to keep the remainder of the
results of any calculation after dividing by 7. Thus, 15 is 1, 33 is 5,
49 is 0, etc.

Every day of the week has a number, starting with 1 for Sunday and
ending with 0 for Saturday. Your goal is to convert any Gregorian
calendar date into such a number.

Jan and Feb belong to the year BEFORE. The reason is that leap years add
a day at the end of Feb and it makes all the math easier to think that
Jan and Feb 1963 are really part of 1962, for example. Also remember
that the Romans started their year with the month of March. Maybe it
was for a similar reason.

Example:

29 Nov 1872.

First convert the century. 1900 happens to be a 0, so that's
really really easy and convenient. The numbers for all other
centuries go in a cycle 6 4 2 0, which is also really easy to
remember: “AGES RUN IN SEQUENCE.” Because 1900 is 0, 2000 is 6,
2100 will be 4, 2200 will be 2, etc. 1800 is 2.

Keep 2 in your head and move forward.

Now convert the year, and there are two steps. First, the year mod 7
because each year is one day longer than a multiple of 7, namely 364. 72
mod 7 is 2. Add 2 to the 2 we're carrying to get 4 so far.

Now get the number of leap years in the century. That's 72 / 4, or
18 discarding the remainder; that's 4. Add it to the 4 we're
keeping, which is 8, which is 1.

Now get the month. Here are mnemonics for months:

| Mar | Irish         | 4 | St. Patrick's Day                 |
| Apr | Easter        | 0 |                                   |
| May | National      | 2 | Memorial Day                      |
| Jun | Altar         | 5 | Lots of weddings in June          |
| Jul | Sun or Summer | 0 | First full sunny month of summer  |
| Aug | Moon          | 3 | Start seeing harvest moons in Aug |
| Sep | Job           | 6 | Labor Day                         |
| Oct | Travel        | 1 | Columbus Day                      |
| Nov | Restaurant    | 4 | Eat turkey in a restaurant        |
| Dec | Church        | 6 | Christmas in a church             |
| Jan | New           | 2 | New-Year's Day                    |
| Feb | Love          | 5 | St. Valentine's Day               |

If you forget one, you can recalculate a month number by just adding up
the 30 = 2 and 31 = 3 days from the beginning of the year in March (mod
7, of course). The day counts for the months go like this:
32323/32323/30, nice easy pattern, or you can sing the “30 days hath
September, April, June, and November” ditty if you prefer. Whatever
works.

We're carrying a 1 in head. Add a 4 for Nov, giving 5. Almost done.

29 mod 7 is 1; add our 5, we get 6. 29 Nov 1872 was a Friday.

Do this a few times and check yourself against Google or
timeanddate.com.  You'll make a few mistakes when getting started, but
after a little while you'll be able to do it quickly and reliably.

Let's try today, 21 May 2022:

#+begin_verse
2000 = 6
22 = + 1 = 0
ly = + 22/4 = 5 discarding the remainder
May = + 2 = 7 = 0
21 = + 0 (Saturday)
#+end_verse

Today is Saturday.

** Person-Action-Object (PAO)
<<pao>>

I recently learned the PAO system and it's quickly becoming my
favorite. Almost magically, it helps you string long
phantasmagorias together, 6 digits---three pegs at a time. It's
not very different from the peg system, and not much more
difficult to devise, but it is a 3X amplifier.

The PAO system associates 3 phantasmagorias to each number. You
build up your PAO system by enhancing the pegs you already know.

For example, consider these enhanced
pegs:

|     | peg  | Person       | Action  | Object         |
|-----+------+--------------+---------+----------------|
|  19 | tap  | CHIMP        | TAPS    | BEER           |
| ... |      |              |         |                |
|  29 | nap  | PUSSYCAT     | NAPS    | on the COUCH   |
|  30 | mass | CONGREGATION | LEAVES  | CHURCH         |
| ... |      |              |         |                |
|  58 | leaf | BREEZE       | RUSTLES | CANADIAN-MAPLE |

If you had to memorize 30291958, you can do it the old way with
four pegs as described earlier in this document, or you can just pick
the Person field for 30, the Action field for 29, the Object field
for 19, the Person field for 58, and so on if there were more
pairs. I quickly get

The CONGREGATION NAPS after drinking BEER and a BREEZE rustles leaves.

I might end up with the same phantasmagoria the old way, but this
way is faster and more robust.

Here are the first few rows of my PAO table. Many of these are
very personal and will surely not work for you. Make sure the
persons are unique amongst themselves, ditto the actions and the
objects.

My table is just an example. Fill out your own table to suit
yourself. You'll find it very quick to do and you will love
memorizing it because the peg are a huge help.

* All Pegs and Sound-Alikes
<<all-pegs>>

Letters for hex, ASCII, and R36, R64 alternative methods are
included in the headers.

** Caps and Rows

Items in ALL CAPS are recommended pegs: visually strong, easy to
reconstruct by enumerating vowels, low collision potential. The
first row in each block contains recommended alternative pegs in
preference order. The rest of the rows are in alphabetical order.

Blocks without items in ALL CAPS do not have recommended pegs as
of this version. Rows in blocks without items in ALL CAPS may not
be ordered.

We work on this list in our hobby time. It will be several
versions before it's finished.

It takes time to come up with good pegs. It's a quadratic process
because one must pick pegs that don't collide visually with the
ones already memorized. Picking a new peg means thinking about all
the others picked so-far. I already have CHAIR for 64 (used all
the time), so SEAT for 01 and THRONE for 142 are not good ideas
for me because they might incorrectly recall 64 at speed.

Most of this this list (except for the double leading zeros) is
automatically constructed from a file named =core.clj= deeper in
the directory tree of the source repository.

Pick your own pegs from this list, or mark your pegs in ALL CAPS
in the =core.clj= file, pick four likely ones for the first line,
sort the rest, and regenerate the PDF

#+begin_example
visiting file core.clj

cider-quit
cider-jack-in
org-babel-execute-buffer

visiting the .org file

remove :results: drawers from any tables you changed
and Ctrl-C Ctrl-C in each babomorph block

org-latex-export-to-pdf
#+end_example

you must either manually evaluate
=core.clj= via =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= or start with a fresh cider-repl
every time, as Clojure caches the results). You may have to
generate the PDF file manually:

=pdflatex -shell-escape how-to-memorize*.tex=

at least twice to regenerate cross-references correctly.

* COMMENT Mental Hash Functions

function that can be computed mentally:

  # pprint({"alphadigits": list(zip(range(1, 27), fdata))})
  def f(ch):
      r"""Map a character to a random number in [0..9]."""
      ch = ch.lower()
      return fdata[ord(ch) - ord('a')]
  gdata = rng.permutation(10)
  print({"permutation": gdata})
  def g(n):
      r"""Get from gdata the character after
      the given one, wrapping. This permutation
      has no fixed points."""
      i = list(gdata).index(n % 10)
      result = gdata[(i+1) % 10]
      assert result != n
      return result
  def hash(text):
